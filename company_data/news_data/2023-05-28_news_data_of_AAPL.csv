MarketWatch: Nvidia barrels toward rare $1 trillion valuation after putting a dollar figure on AI boost,MarketWatch,2023-05-24T22:16:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-barrels-toward-rare-1-trillion-valuation-after-putting-a-dollar-figure-on-ai-boost-443b7d0f,"Nvidia Corp. headed toward market-capitalization gains of nearly $200 billion in after-hours trading Wednesday, which could put the chip maker within sight of becoming only the seventh U.S. company to top a valuation of $1 trillion.

Nvidia shares NVDA jumped 25% in the extended session Wednesday, after executives predicted that revenue would exceed the company’s record by more than 30% in the current quarter. The audacious forecast arrived as tech companies look to jump on advances in artificial intelligence that are largely powered by Nvidia’s computing gear.

Nvidia ended Wednesday’s session with a market cap — the total value of all shares in existence — of roughly $754.3 billion, according to FactSet. A 25% increase would add nearly $189 billion to that total, putting the company within striking distance of $1 trillion. Only six U.S. companies have ever attained a $1 trillion market cap: Apple Inc. AAPL and Microsoft Corp. MSFT are currently worth more than $2 trillion apiece; Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN have valuation of more than $1 trillion; and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META and Tesla Inc. TSLA have both touched the $1 trillion plateau previously.

Nvidia’s market cap was ahead of both Meta and Tesla as of Wednesday’s close, with both worth less than $650 billion, showing the potential fleeting nature of such a valuation. Nvidia’s record market cap is $834.4 billion, established on Nov. 29. 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

If Nvidia’s gains hold through Thursday’s trading session, the company could challenge for the largest one-day market-cap gain in history. The biggest currently on record was Amazon’s $191.2 billion increase on Feb. 4, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data, followed closely by a $190.9 billion gain by Apple on Nov. 10, 2022. Nvidia also stands to gain more than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD is worth in total — AMD ended Wednesday’s session with a market cap of $174.4 billion.

Nvidia is closing in on the rare $1 trillion plateau because of huge gains in its stock this year, as hopes and hype about generative AI have flooded the tech sector. After OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT AI offering, and investor Microsoft quickly integrated the chatbot into many of its services, expectations for the technology have exploded.

Despite the hype, most companies have avoided providing hard figures for revenue gains expected from AI. Nvidia’s fiscal second-quarter forecast — which calls for roughly $11 billion in sales, nearly 33% higher than Nvidia’s previous quarterly record of $8.28 billion — could be seen as the first sign of a wave of fresh spending coursing through the tech sector.

Other companies have indicated that they will be forced to spend to develop their technology before reaping large financial rewards from it. Microsoft, for example, disclosed to investors last month that capital expenditures are increasing as it builds AI capabilities into its Azure cloud-computing platform — spending that is largely going toward Nvidia.

That is a rather typical path for large jumps in tech spending: Companies that make the necessary hardware see gains before the companies that use that gear can develop offerings that take advantage of it. Other gear makers joined Nvidia in the sharp move higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, including AMD, which gained more than 10%; chip maker Marvell Technology Inc. MRVL, which increased more than 5%; and networking specialist Arista Networks Inc. ANET, which added about 5%.

Alphabet and Microsoft stocks both increased around 2% in after-hours trading, and software companies that have made AI a core part of their offerings also saw gains. Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR and C3.ai Inc. AI shares both increased more than 8%, for example."
"In One Chart: Stock market’s AI frenzy reinforces this crucial rule for traders, RenMac says",MarketWatch,2023-05-26T15:37:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-ai-frenzy-reinforces-this-crucial-rule-for-traders-renmac-says-fc248f84,"A mind-blowing Thursday surge by shares of chip maker Nvidia Corp. that fed a frenzy for artificial-intelligence stock market plays reinforces a cardinal rule for traders, said a technician at a top Wall Street research firm.

“Yesterday’s move in NVDA was one for the record books,” said Kevin Dempter, analyst at Renaissance Macro Research, in a Friday note. It also served as an example of the rule the firm preaches above all others, he said, which is to “‘not fear momentum.’”

Shares of Nvidia NVDA, +2.54% jumped 24% Thursday, putting a $1 trillion valuation in sight, after it delivered a blowout earnings forecast centered on soaring demand for chips related to artificial-inteligence applications. That built on an already staggering upside run for the stock, which is up nearly 160% so far in 2023.

Read: Nvidia stock is the most overbought in 18 months, but that doesn’t mean the rally is over

“Just because a strong stock or sector is overbought after a big run doesn’t mean you should sell it. Strength begets strength and the rich get richer, embrace momentum,” Dempter wrote. (See chart below.)

Renaissance Macro Research

Nvidia shares added another 2.5% on Friday, while the megacap-tech-concentrated Nasdaq-100 NDX, +2.58% logged a 3.4% weekly gain, up more than 30% for the year to date. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% rose 1.3% Friday, turning positive on the week and up around 9.5% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.00% bounced Friday, snapping a five-day losing streak but logging a 1% weekly fall.

See: ‘Unprecedented’ and ‘unfathomable.’ Nvidia makes jaws drop on Wall Street as stock explodes higher.

So should investors chase the rally? Not so fast there, either.

Dempter said RenMac still wouldn’t fade the move, but it might pay now to be patient and let overbought conditions get worked off before looking to add positions.

He noted that the rally comes amid a list of understandable reasons for caution. The breadth — the number of stocks advancing versus declining — continues to weaken, with just 37% of the issues in the broad S&P 1500 index above their 200-day moving average and new 20-day lows outnumbering 20-day highs. The equal-weight measure of the S&P 500 recently witnessed a “dark” or “death” cross in which the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.

And the AI rally has some market watchers pondering if another bubble may be in the works.

Fidelity’s MSCI Information Technology ETF FTEC, +2.68% , which allocates 23% to Apple, AAPL, +1.41% 19% to Microsoft MSFT, +2.14% and 6% to Nvidia was up by more than 3.5% Thursday, and 40% since last October 2022 dip. It currently trades 30 times the earnings, while the S&P500’s price-to-earnings ratio is only around 22, noted Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, in a note. She observed that Nvidia’s P/E ratio spiked to 219 Thursday.

It all points to a “bubble in the making” for AI-related stocks, she said, warning that it “could soon be time for a correction.”

Dempter said that despite broader market concerns, “we still want to embrace those areas that are breaking out [with] momentum. It may be narrow, but we would remain overweight tech and would stick with the leaders while embracing improving trends in the sector,” he said.

It’s hard to say how the AI boom will play out, but Dempter argued it’s smart to stay long the names that have already benefited most.

AMZN vs. AAPL: Which Big Tech Stock is Better? - TipRanks,Google News,2023-05-25T21:48:29Z,https://consent.google.com/ml?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvYW16bi12cy1hYXBsLXdoaWNoLWJpZy10ZWNoLXN0b2NrLWlzLWJldHRlctIBAA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&hl=en-US&cm=2&pc=n&src=1,"In this piece, I evaluated two big tech stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Of course, Amazon and Apple need no introduction. Amazon has exploded 34% year-to-date, bringing its one-year return to 3.5%. Meanwhile, Apple is up 38.7% year-to-date and 21% over the last year. Notably, Apple is trading close to its record high, while Amazon is significantly off its all-time high.

Technology stocks have been broadly outperforming those in other sectors. Although tech names make up several of the highest-weighted names in the S&P 500 (SPX), it has gained about 8% year-to-date versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s (NDX) 26% year-to-date gain. Thus, investors might be wondering whether there’s any near-term upside left, so a closer look is in order.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Amazon has faced some issues recently that may be restraining its stock. However, given its long-term stability, a bullish view looks appropriate, as the current restraints on its stock price appear to have created a nice entry point for investors.

It’s long been a challenge to estimate Amazon’s valuation because it has so many moving parts. In addition to the e-commerce business the company is so well-known for, it also has recurring revenue in the form of Prime subscriptions.

Additionally, the Amazon Web Services platform serves numerous companies. Amazon also has its own devices and other branded products for sale on its platform and is developing various technologies, including Alexa, its digital assistant backed by artificial intelligence.

Notably, hedge funds unloaded 10 million shares of Amazon in the last quarter, which is one driver of the sell-off. Still, the company’s Retail segment generated $343 million in operating losses for the first quarter, a massive improvement from the $2.85 billion it lost in the year-ago quarter. Amazon Web Services continues to generate Amazon’s profits, although its operating expenses have risen, just as they have at other tech companies.

Amazon’s net income margin fell into the red for 2022, at -0.5%, but it began to recover in the first quarter, coming in at 0.8% for the last 12 months. As things stand now, it looks like Amazon is starting to recover, which is why its stock is up so much year-to-date. However, it looks like there will be more room to run in the near term.

Even if Amazon shares stagnate temporarily, I believe that buying and holding them for the long term will likely generate solid returns because this company isn’t going anywhere.

What is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?

Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 35 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $134.85, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 17.3%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

On the one hand, Apple is one stock many investors buy and hold for the long term. However, on the other, the iPhone maker is trading close to its record high, making Amazon look like the better value option. Since a better entry point appears likely in the near future, a neutral view seems appropriate for Apple, but only in the short term.

Like Amazon, Apple is a stable, steadily-growing technology company. Of course, it’s far more profitable, as it isn’t saddled with an e-commerce business that often loses money and retains ultra-low profits when it’s in the green. However, Apple is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29.2 versus its five-year average P/E of 25.4, making it look slightly overvalued.

While hedge funds widely sold Amazon, they gobbled up over 16 million shares of Apple in the last quarter. Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) also bought more Apple shares in the last quarter.

What is the Price Target for AAPL Stock?

Apple has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $181.88, the average Apple stock price target implies upside potential of 5.1%.

Conclusion: Bullish on AMZN, Short-Term Neutral on AAPL

At this stage, it’s hard to go wrong with either Amazon or Apple. Many investors consider Amazon and Apple as both stocks they would buy and hold for the long term. Neither company looks like they’re in danger, as they are both stable and growing, but Amazon looks slightly better than Apple in terms of its valuation.

Of course, though, a recession or general downtick in investor sentiment for tech stocks could create better entry points for both.

Apple's iOS operating system is the company's unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives particularly tight engagement with consumers and enterprises, which is fostering the growing purchase of high margin services like music, apps, and Apple Pay. While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives. Aside from production disruptions, negative sentiment had also weighed on shares as investors questioned how an economic slowdown would affect consumer demand for Apple products in 2023. However, management projected an acceleration in earnings for the fiscal first quarter, where they noted that iPhone and services growth should remain strong, along with encouraging impacts around product mix, lower input costs, and continued cost controls.""

The Moneyist: ‘Her behavior is egregious’: My sister blocked my number. Should I remove her from our $70-per-month family phone plan?,MarketWatch,2023-05-23T18:18:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/her-behavior-is-egregious-my-sister-blocked-my-number-should-i-remove-her-from-our-70-per-month-family-phone-plan-3db80621,"My sister and I, both adults who are married, have run into some major problems in our relationship with each other. We have always been close but we grew up in a tumultuous household that has left us both with deep emotional scars.

Recently, she has decided to at least, in my opinion, project her emotional baggage onto me. This has resulted in her deciding not to talk to me and blocking my cell number. The core financial issue here is that I pay for the cell phone bill as we are all still on a family plan!

I pay roughly $70 per month, which includes her monthly installment. I think her behavior is egregious — to block my number and expect me to continue paying her bill. I don’t however want to hurt our relationship further as I hope to reconcile. Should I remove her from the plan?

The Other Sister

Dear Sister,

For whatever reason, your sister is angry, and blocking your number is a way of expressing her frustration, but it’s also a way for her to disassociate from the relationship. Blocking you is an easy way to avoid conflict and stress. Pressing the block button is far from an ideal way to manage a relationship, unless you are protecting yourself from an abusive situation or a stalker.

But like many such acts involving technology — blocking you on your iPhone AAPL, +1.41% , unfollowing on Twitter, unfriending on Facebook META, +3.70% — it’s a bold statement and often done in the heat of the moment. One little push of a button can result in an epic fallout for the injured party. But kicking her off the family cell-phone plan will only escalate the situation, and add fuel to the fire.

“‘At some point in life, we need to find the kindest path, particularly if we want that person in our life long-term.’”

At some point in life, we need to find the kindest path, particularly if we want that person in our life long-term. You will never have another sister who will be as beautifully imperfect as this one. You grew up in a dysfunctional household, and you are dealing with the ramifications of that. You may have learned to lash out when you are hurt and retaliate. It creates a cycle of pain.

Someone needs to be the adult you never had growing up. Let that person be you. If your sister is on your family plan, I assume she needs financial support. Pulling the plug on her cell-phone coverage could have far bigger consequences for her than this relationship. She will need her phone for work, and to pay bills, in addition to seeking out support from friends and family.

The knee-jerk reaction would be to kick her off the family plan. But we are also living in an environment of rising inflation, economic uncertainty, and the looming threat of a recession. Write your sister a letter, offering to talk whenever she is ready. But retaliation, especially when it could have serious financial and professional implications for your sister, is not the answer.

Apple's AI-Powered Initiatives Poised for Big Gains,Motley Fool,2023-05-23T10:10:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/23/apples-ai-powered-initiatives-poised-for-big-gains/,"It seems like every technology company is now talking about artificial intelligence (AI). However, Apple (AAPL 1.41%) remains somewhat tight-lipped on its plans to integrate AI into its business.

That could soon change. Recent reports suggest Apple will unveil a new hardware product, and the speculation is that it's an augmented reality headset. Additionally, Apple steadily introduces new features to existing products that use AI to create a better user experience.

Painting a picture of Apple's plans requires first understanding the company's core business model. Here is how AI can set Apple and its investors up for continued long-term success.

Apple is all about bolstering its ecosystem

Selling smartphones, headphones, and computers is essential to Apple's business. Hardware sales still make up the majority of revenue, about 80% of sales through the six months ending April 1. But services, the other 20%, made up almost a third of Apple's gross profit over that time.

These services include App Store purchases, media, and subscription services like Music and Arcade. Apple makes money on its hardware sales, but the goal is to grow its user base and monetize it as much as possible by getting you to use your iPhone or other Apple device throughout everyday life. You can think of an iPhone as a customer acquisition tool.

There are over 1 billion iPhone users worldwide, and each accessory and device works seamlessly together. For example, you can download a new song to your library on your iPhone, and it will update across your MacBook or other devices. Apple's hardware isn't cheap for most individuals, so someone with an iPhone, AirPods, and an Apple Watch will probably hesitate to switch to another brand once they buy.

Headset incoming?

The iPhone has carried Apple's growth for years. While that's probably not changing anytime soon, Apple isn't sitting on its hands. Forbes reported that Apple could soon reveal a new hardware product, an augmented reality headset.

It will likely start as a niche device; the reported price will come in at around $3,000, something your average consumer may struggle to afford. Apple wants the headset to be a device that users wear throughout their day, even replacing some tasks that people use their iPhones for. While it may not become the next iPhone (or maybe it does), the company has proven its ability to grow hardware categories with products like the Apple Watch and AirPods.

The device's ability to give users an experience that integrates well with existing hardware will be crucial. Remember, every piece of hardware is designed to play nice with other devices and keep users inside the ecosystem.

AI isn't the star, it's the glue that keeps you stuck

Artificial intelligence may not become Apple's front-and-center focus, but it could play a significant role for the company. Apple's most likely strategy is to use AI to augment its user experience, strengthening its ecosystem to make it even more sticky for users.

You've already seen examples of this, such as facial recognition, photo editing features, and more. What if Apple upgraded Siri to give it ChatGPT-like smarts? Or it used AI to better recommend games, apps, music, and movies to users, driving engagement in the Apple iTunes store?

Years from now, your Apple devices might seemingly know you better than you know yourself, perhaps predicting what you want to do or see next based on your daily tendencies. Apple mastered hardware design and built a sticky ecosystem that created staggering success. The next move could be using AI to make its ecosystem an even more integral part of your daily life.

What to do with shares -- today

The AI hype has pushed shares up 30% since January to nearly 30 times earnings. While Apple's potential new headset and AI applications could play a role in the company's long-term growth, it's still very early, so don't tempt yourself into chasing shares at any price. Apple's the world's largest publicly traded company, and dramatically overpaying for the stock could hurt your returns.

Analysts believe the company's earnings-per-share (EPS) will grow to nearly $9 by 2028. That means investors could see virtually zero price appreciation for the next five years if the stock traded down to its long-term average valuation. Apple is a great business that investors should want to hold more than trade, but the recent hype should push new money to the sidelines until prices come down a bit."
Warren Buffett Just Bought More Apple Shares. Should You?,Motley Fool,2023-05-25T11:30:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/warren-buffett-just-bought-more-apple-shares-shoul/,"If you look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, you can see a clear preference for one company: Apple (AAPL 1.41%). Berkshire's stake in the company is worth over $156 billion -- an incredible 47% of its investment portfolio. With Berkshire's $700 billion market cap, it's not unfair to say that over a fifth of the company is Apple.

While most investors would be uncomfortable with that concentration level, Berkshire clearly isn't. It added 20 million more shares (about a 2% increase in its stake) during the first quarter. So should you follow Buffett's example with Apple, or are there better investments out there? Let's take a look.

Is Buffett forsaking his value-investing roots?

Apple's products have become a staple for the American consumer. Whether it's a MacBook, AirPods, or the ever-popular iPhone lineup, Apple has successfully launched and developed a product ecosystem few companies could ever dream of achieving.

It has also been responsible with its finances, garnering praise from Buffett and his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, for many years.

These two, along with many in the financial media, have cheered investors on to own more Apple stock, since it has been one of the best-executing businesses since Buffett established his position in 2016.

To be clear, this investment has worked out well over the past decade, with a total return of 629% versus the S&P 500's 135%. But the price of Apple's stock makes me scratch my head at Buffett's latest move, since he is a famous value investor.

When Berkshire first bought Apple in 2016, the stock had a dirt cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12. Now, it's valued at around 30 times earnings.

This valuation increase isn't entirely due to widespread coverage of Apple stock ownership; a lot of it has to deal with the company's improving profitability. Even though it has only moved up 3 percentage points, when the company generates nearly $400 billion in revenue, that works out to $12 billion more in profits -- a massive increase.

Still, is that enough to warrant a valuation near 30 times earnings? I don't think so.

Apple isn't putting up the growth needed for its valuation

An earnings multiple of 30 is usually reserved for a rapidly growing company -- something Apple isn't. In fact, its revenue fell nearly 3% in the second quarter (ending April 1). While profit margins stayed relatively stable, its earnings per share fell $0.01 because of the revenue drop.

That revenue drop can be attributed to a weaker consumer, but it also reflects how difficult it is to grow when you have become that large. Even in 2024, when many companies expect the economy to return to strength, Wall Street analysts only project 6.4% revenue growth.

Apple will likely need to grow faster to maintain a premium valuation like that.

So, do I think the stock will come crashing down? Absolutely not. Because of its widespread ownership individually and through index funds (Apple makes up 7.4% of the S&P 500 and 12.5% of the Nasdaq 100), the shares have become insulated from rapid drops, because it would require a lot of investors to sell at once.

But I don't think Apple can deliver the growth it needs. A significant portion of the stock's performance over these past few years has come from multiple expansions, or when investors are willing to pay a more significant premium for the stock.

With that catalyst gone, it has to deliver based on business performance. While it can still succeed at the business level, it won't be as fast as some other companies are growing, which is why I think investors looking for greater upside should look elsewhere.

Still, if you want a steady company as a parking spot for your savings before retirement or to stabilize your portfolio (similar to how Berkshire is doing it), you could do much worse than Apple.

Apple stock has its place in life, but if you're looking for the best possible returns, it doesn't fit the bill from a forward-looking standpoint."
Want Passive Income Forever? Buy These 2 Magnificent Stocks Now,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T13:53:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/want-passive-income-forever-buy-these-magnificent/,"Many investors actively seek dividend stocks, and who can blame them? Nothing beats making money while you sleep. But when investing in dividend-paying companies, there is always the risk that these corporations will reduce or suspend their payouts altogether. Choosing the right dividend stocks is arguably the best way to avoid this risk: Not all dividend stocks are created equal.

With that said, let's turn our attention to two companies that are practically passive income machines and will likely continue rewarding shareholders with payout increases for a long time: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.04%) and Apple (AAPL 1.41%).

1. Johnson & Johnson

Johnson & Johnson has a history that dates back more than 100 years. Most businesses struggle to survive a decade, so this feat is highly impressive. It's because J&J offers goods that are always in high demand. It is a leading pharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of medicines spanning several therapeutic areas, from infectious diseases to oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and more.

Moreover, Johnson & Johnson spends ample money on research and development and routinely adds new products to its vast portfolio. Drugmakers can cease being relevant if they stop innovating. That is unlikely to happen to this pharma giant. The company's medical devices unit also offers a range of products that physicians use to improve health outcomes for their patients.

Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson records consistent revenue, profits, and free cash flow.

Financial health is essential as no company can sustain dividend increases over the long run without that. And as an added piece of evidence of Johnson & Johnson's financial health, the company boasts an AAA rating from Standard & Poor, a testament to its strong balance sheet. Even if the U.S. Federal Reserve's predicted recession hits us before the end of the year, the healthcare giant should be just fine.

Johnson & Johnson has had to navigate various lawsuits against it in recent years regarding opioids as well as its talc-based baby powder, but these processes will play themselves out eventually. The company has survived plenty of downturns and challenges in its long history.

Finally, Johnson & Johnson has been excellent at hiking its payouts. The drugmaker is a Dividend King. It is currently on its 60th consecutive year of dividend increases. Very few corporations have a better track record. Johnson & Johnson's current 3.03% dividend yield is above that of the S&P 500 at 1.66%.

Although its cash payout ratio of 73% seems high, the company has the tools necessary to continue doing what it has been doing for a long time: slowly and steadily growing its dividend. Investors can sleep easy knowing that Johnson & Johnson's payouts are secure.

2. Apple

Apple isn't in the business of selling medicines. Most of the things it offers are, strictly speaking, goods that can eventually become obsolete. But the company is still an excellent stock to buy and hold forever. Here is why: Apple has built an incredibly strong brand name and a culture of technological innovation.

The company is an expert at transforming existing tech into better and more sophisticated versions of essentially the same thing. Cell phones existed before the iPhone, and AirPods are just fancy earbuds, among other examples. Once branded with its logo, these devices typically command high prices, even though plenty of cheaper substitutes are available. That speaks to Apple's customer loyalty, a powerful competitive edge.

That's why the company reports solid financial results even in challenging economic times.

AAPL Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.

However, Apple has been seeking to diversify its revenue base. It increasingly relies on its services segment, which offers everything from Apple Cloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and much more. This business still makes up a small percentage of its top line, but it has grown in importance. Apple's installed base now stands at more than two billion devices worldwide.

The company should benefit from this for years to come as it finds new ways to monetize its large base of customers. Apple is making headway in fintech and has also been looking to enter the healthcare industry in some way. Turning to the company's dividends, its 0.55% yield is low, but it has raised its payouts by 120% in the past decade. With a very modest cash-payout ratio of 15.3%, there are miles of room left for more hikes.

While not primarily known for its dividends, Apple can give passive income seekers exactly what they want while delivering market-beating returns."
A Boost for 'Made in America': Apple and Broadcom Tag-Team for Homegrown 5G,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T16:02:02Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boost-made-america-apple-broadcom-160202290.html,"A Boost for 'Made in America': Apple and Broadcom Tag-Team for Homegrown 5G

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock gained Tuesday after forging a multibillion-dollar deal with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) to manufacture components in the U.S.

The semiconductor supplier will develop 5G radio frequency components — including FBAR filters — and cutting-edge wireless connectivity components under the deal.

It will design and build the FBAR filters in several critical American manufacturing and technology hubs, including Fort Collins, Colorado, where Broadcom has a significant facility.

Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, said, ""All of Apple's products depend on technology engineered and built here in the United States, and we'll continue to deepen our investments in the U.S. economy because we have an unshakable belief in America's future.""

Apple already helps support over 1,100 jobs in Broadcom's Fort Collins FBAR filter manufacturing facility, and the deal will enable Broadcom to continue to invest in critical automation projects. Across the country, Apple supports over 2.7 million jobs.

Apple is splurging in tens of billions of dollars to develop 5G technology in the U.S. under its commitment in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over five years.

Countries, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan, have been splurging to boost their semiconductor manufacturing capacity since China's pandemic outbreak hammered the global supply chains fueling an intense chip and component crisis.

Price Action: AVGO shares traded higher by 0.75% at $683.50 on the last check Tuesday.

Here's How Apple Is Making iPhone More Useful Via iOS 17 When Lying Idle And A Lot More,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-25T14:31:43Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-apple-making-iphone-more-143143665.html,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) eyed a new interface for iPhones to make them more useful while lying idle via its iOS 17 software update, Dawn, which will reach consumers in 2023.

The new interface will show information, including calendar appointments, the weather, and notifications in the style of a smart-home display, Bloomberg cites knowledgeable sources.

The view will appear when an iPhone is locked and positioned horizontally, similar to that of Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).

Apple plans to showcase the software launch alongside its mixed-reality headset at the Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5.

The move marks its broader push to embed live information in more parts of the company’s software, including the Apple Watch’s interface.

The Apple feature will use a dark background with bright text. It proposes to build on the company’s launch of lock screen widgets in 2022 as part of iOS 16.

The iPhone maker is also working on a new horizontal interface for the iPad.

Apple is exploring other ways to turn its devices into smart-home displays, like developing a low-cost tablet that can magnetically attach to walls and stands.

As part of iOS 17, Apple is also planning significant changes to the iPhone’s Wallet app and location services. Apple eyes a new journaling app to add note-taking.

The company proposes incorporating health changes with new features for logging mood and coping with weak vision. Apple is planning to bring the Health app to the iPad.

Apple is also working on upgrades for SharePlay, its feature that lets users FaceTime while collaborating in apps, and AirPlay, which beams content from Apple devices to TVs and speakers."
"1 Green Flag for Broadcom in 2023, and 1 Red Flag",Motley Fool,2023-05-25T13:26:01Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/1-green-flag-for-broadcom-in-2023-and-1-red-flag/,"Broadcom's (AVGO 11.52%) stock is up about 30% over the past 12 months, bucking the broader slowdown in the semiconductor market. It outperformed most of its peers because its deep diversification across the data center, networking, wireless, storage, and industrial chip markets insulated it from the post-pandemic slowdown of the PC and smartphone markets. It also diversified its business away from semiconductors with the expansion of its infrastructure software business.

Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last October), Broadcom's revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%, while its adjusted EPS rose at a CAGR of 19%. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 7% and 10%, respectively, this year, even as the macroeconomic headwinds rattle the broader markets.

Its stock looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings, and it pays a respectable forward yield of 2.7%. All those facts and figures suggest Broadcom is still worth buying at these levels. But investors should take note of two recent events -- which can be considered as a green flag and a red flag for its future -- before pressing the ""sell"" button.

The green flag: A new multibillion-dollar deal with Apple

Broadcom produces Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, wireless charging, and other radio frequency chips for Apple's (AAPL 1.41%) iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Back in 2020, Apple and Broadcom galvanized that long-term relationship with exclusive contracts that would pay the chipmaker approximately $15 billion in revenue through 2023.

However, several reports from earlier this year suggested Apple could replace Broadcom's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chips with its own first-party chips by 2025. Those rumors cast dark clouds over Broadcom's future since the company relied on Apple for 20% of revenue in fiscal 2022.

But some of those clouds recently parted when Apple announced that it had inked a new multibillion-dollar agreement to purchase Broadcom's 5G radio frequency components and other wireless connectivity parts from Broadcom over the next few years.

Apple didn't specify the exact value or length of the deal (or if it includes its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chips), but it allays some bearish concerns that Apple could unexpectedly replace all of Broadcom's chips with its own first-party silicon.

The red flag: The VMware deal is still stuck in the mud

To diversify its business away from Apple and the cyclical semiconductor market, Broadcom expanded its infrastructure software division with its acquisitions of CA in 2018 and Symantec's enterprise security unit in 2019. In 2022, it agreed to buy the cloud software giant VMware (VMW 4.21%) for $61 billion.

That takeover would enable Broadcom to generate about half of its revenue from infrastructure software, compared to just 29% of its revenue in fiscal 2022. But that deal still faces intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe.

In March, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the deal that will last through September. In April, the European Commission (EC) sent Broadcom a ""statement of objections"" to the deal, saying that it could restrict competition in certain product categories. The EC also recently extended its deadline for making a final call on that deal from June 21 to July 17.

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has reportedly been trying to garner enough third-party support to launch a full-blown antitrust lawsuit against Broadcom. In other words, Broadcom's planned takeover of VMware could remain in limbo for a very long time.

Which of these flags should be flown higher?

Broadcom's VMware deal faces a lot of regulatory hurdles, but that isn't all that surprising given the size of the deal. Meanwhile, Apple's big deal with Broadcom is more interesting and newsworthy -- especially since investors had been bracing for a sudden divorce between the two companies. Therefore, I believe that the green flag should fly a lot higher than the red flag."
Is Microsoft Stock a Buy?,Motley Fool,2023-05-25T12:37:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/is-microsoft-stock-a-buy/,"Tech investors have had a good year so far, but the 22% surge in the Nasdaq Composite index still pales in comparison to the returns that Microsoft (MSFT 2.14%) owners have seen. The software giant is up over 30% through mid-May, in fact.

Wall Street is excited about the prospects for its cloud services division and the potential for a generally strong selling environment ahead for enterprise software. Looking further out, Microsoft might see excellent returns from attractive niches like video games, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI).

But does the over $2 trillion valuation on the business mean that expectations are too high for investors to see decent returns from here? Let's take a closer look.

More diverse than Apple

Microsoft and Apple (AAPL 1.41%) both have valuations over $2 trillion, yet Microsoft delivers more diversification than the iPhone maker does. Owning this stock means an investor is exposed to several growing tech segments like cybersecurity, subscription gaming services, and cloud enterprise software. That range of growth prospects is possible to achieve without owning Microsoft stock, but would require an investor to buy several other niche players.

The company's latest results show the strength of having this deep portfolio. While parts of the business, like games and PC hardware, shrank in early 2023, Microsoft's global revenue still rose 10%. Apple's sales ticked lower by about 3%, by comparison.

Profits and cash flow

The financial risk for Microsoft investors is also relatively low. The tech stock maintains some of the highest profitability on the market, with operating profit margin now sitting above 40% of sales. Microsoft generated $59 billion of operating cash flow over the past nine months, down only slightly from the prior-year period.

Its ample cash generation has allowed executives to build up a large savings even as they invest in growth initiatives like AI and the Activision Blizzard acquisition. There's always the risk that big moves like this will destroy shareholder value. But Microsoft's track record has been generally positive on this score.

Paying up

That means the biggest risk for prospective investors is paying too high of a price for this profitable business. That's not a hard case to make given that Microsoft shares are valued at over 11 times annual sales compared to the pandemic high of about 13. Apple can be bought for 7 times revenue, by comparison. There are some rational reasons to believe that this premium valuation can drop over the next few years, including a downturn in IT spending or disappointing returns from AI investments and the Activision purchase.

On the other hand, Microsoft can also grow into that valuation by continuing to expand sales at a double-digit rate while maintaining its market-thumping profitability. And, either way, shareholders are likely to see strong returns, including direct cash returns from stock buyback spending and dividends. While Microsoft isn't going to double its market capitalization anytime soon, investors can still generate market-beating returns by holding the stock as part of a diverse growth-focused portfolio."
Apple Just Announced a Multibillion-Dollar Deal With Broadcom -- Here's What Investors Should Know,Motley Fool,2023-05-23T20:20:46Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/23/apple-just-announced-a-multibillion-dollar-deal-wi/,"In early 2018, Apple (AAPL 1.41%) announced plans to invest $350 billion in the U.S. economy. At the time, the company said this set of investments would be concentrated on those areas where Apple could have the ""greatest impact on job creation."" These included direct employee hiring, spending and investment involving domestic manufacturers and suppliers, and fueling the ""fast-growing app economy.""

The tech giant later raised that commitment to $430 billion over five years, including a proposed campus in North Carolina and greater investment in 5G technology.

Apple just took another big step in fulfilling its pledge, striking a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO 11.52%) to create components for its devices that will be made in the U.S.

A big focus on 5G

In a press release on Tuesday, Apple said it struck a major deal with Broadcom for a variety of 5G radio frequency components. The technology, which will be developed by Broadcom, will include Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) filters, which are precision electronic filters that help focus inbound and outbound wireless signals, while reducing interference, which ensures it transmits and receives only those communications intended for that specific device.

The agreement also covers a number of other ""cutting-edge wireless connectivity components."" Apple noted that the FBAR filters would be ""designed and built in several key American manufacturing and technology hubs, including Fort Collins, Colorado, where Broadcom has a major facility."" Apple said it already helps support 1,100 jobs at the plant and ""the partnership will enable Broadcom to continue to invest in critical automation projects and upskilling with technicians and engineers.""

A regulatory filing by Broadcom revealed the company had entered into two separate multiyear agreements with Apple, ""for the supply of a range of specified high-performance RF and wireless components and modules for use in Apple products."" The filing was mum as to the specific value of each deal.

Apple launched its 5G-enabled iPhone in 2020 and has since expanded the technology to other devices including the iPad Pro and Apple Watch.

Broadcom investors rejoice

This is welcome news for Broadcom shareholders, who have been justifiably concerned about the prospect of losing a large portion of its annual sales from the iPhone maker. In recent months, there have been multiple reports suggesting that Apple planned to part ways with Broadcom, replacing a number of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth processors in favor of chips of its own design.

The iPhone maker is reportedly Broadcom's largest single customer in its most recent fiscal year, representing roughly 20% of Broadcom's revenue, or about $7 billion. If the reports were true, it was expected to hit Broadcom's sales to the tune of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, according to estimates by AB Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.

What it means for Apple

Like so many companies, Apple struggled with supply chain and logistics issues during the pandemic. Over the past couple of years, the company was hit by widespread product delays due to its heavy dependance on manufacturers in China and the concentration of its suppliers.

Since then, Apple has been working to restructure its supply chain to reduce its reliance on the country, after suffering a supply shortage of its signature iPhone during its crucial holiday season as well as longer-than-normal shipping delays. Apple has been expanding its manufacturing into new countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to reduce this risk. Furthermore, Apple will be moving the production of some of its semiconductors to a new foundry in Arizona, being constructed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

While there's no way to quantify the deal for Apple, this is just another sign of the progress the company is making to reduce the risk of future supply chain disruptions."
"Amid the Deal with Apple, Is It Too Late to Buy Broadcom Stock?",Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:25:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/amid-deal-apple-too-late-buy-broadcom-stock/,"In a move that surprised some investors and analysts, Apple (AAPL 1.41%) signed a new multi-billion deal with Broadcom (AVGO 11.52%), which will drive the development of components related to 5G radio frequencies. The announcement sent Broadcom stock higher as the relationship between the two companies expanded.

Of course, this semiconductor stock was already on the rise before the announcement, so the added news now has the stock trading at record highs. Given its already elevated stock price, does this latest deal make Broadcom a buy, or did investors miss their opportunity?

The Apple-Broadcom deal

Broadcom's chip segment develops semiconductors for other companies. It invests billions per year in research and development, and it employs engineers near its large clients to develop solutions collaboratively. One fan of its approach is Apple, which was an important Broadcom client before this deal. Broadcom designs the chips that power the Wi-Fi hotspot for the iPhone and other products, and this relationship accounted for about 20% of Broadcom's revenue in 2022.

Much remains unknown about the new deal. Neither company disclosed financial terms, although Apple said the agreement was part of a commitment made in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy.

Moreover, Apple has recently brought more chip development in-house and wanted to develop its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, according to a Bloomberg report. Until recently, this led to fears that Apple would scale back its relationship with Broadcom. Hence investors probably looked at this perceived turnabout as a surprise.

The state of Broadcom's stock

As mentioned before, investors expressed their surprise at the deal by bidding Broadcom stock up to record highs. Consequently, Broadcom's stock price is up more than 25% over the last 12 months.

And even after declining for most of 2022, revenue and profits continue to surge. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 29), revenue of $8.9 billion rose 12% year over year, primarily driven by a 17% increase in product sales.

During that time, it limited increases in the cost of revenue and reduced operating expenses. That helped it report a quarterly net income of $3.8 billion, rising 57% compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2022.

Surprisingly, its rising stock price has not made Broadcom an expensive stock, as it sells at a P/E ratio of 23. That multiple is above multi-year lows, but it still trades at a lower valuation than Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices. Additionally, Broadcom remains one of the more lucrative dividend stocks in the semiconductor industry. At $18.40 per share annually, it claims a dividend yield of about 2.5%, well above the 1.6% average of the S&P 500.

Also, that payout has risen annually since 2011, with the dividend increasing by 12% after the most recent increase. This cash return provided stability amid the stock's considerable growth. And because the company's $3.9 billion quarterly free cash flow far exceeded the $1.9 billion dividend cost for the period, its payout should stay safe.

Should I consider Broadcom?

Despite a multi-billion deal with Apple, it is not too late to buy Broadcom stock. Admittedly, most investors would probably like more details on the terms of this specific deal.

However, Broadcom posted solid growth in fiscal Q1 before the deal. Due to its P/E ratio of 23 and a high dividend, the stock appears undervalued. And with the company strengthening its relationship with Apple, Broadcom stock will likely continue to move higher over time."
3 Top AI Stocks That Pay Dividends -- and 1 Yields Over 5%,Motley Fool,2023-05-25T09:52:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/3-top-ai-stocks-that-pay-dividends-1-yields-over-5/,"Income investors can find their portfolios loaded with boring companies. That's not a bad thing, though. Boring companies often provide the most reliable dividends.

However, it's possible to receive income and invest in one of the most exciting opportunities on the planet -- artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three top AI stocks that pay dividends.

1. IBM

IBM (IBM 1.68%) has been a favorite for income investors for years, and it still is. The tech giant offers a dividend yield of nearly 5.2%. IBM has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1916 and increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years.

Sure, IBM hasn't been at the center of attention with the recent surge in interest in AI. However, the company has been an AI pioneer for a long time. For example, its Watson technology made headlines in 2011 by beating Jeopardy! champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.

But is IBM still a contender in AI? Yep. IBM remains an industry leader in the number of AI patents held. Gartner's Magic Quadrant ranks the company as a leader in conversational AI. IBM Watson is now being used across of wide range of industries.

2. Microsoft

Unlike IBM, Microsoft (MSFT 2.14%) has been at the forefront of the AI world this year. The company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Microsoft has also integrated OpenAI's generative AI technology into its products, including its Bing search engine.

These AI efforts have caught investors' attention. Microsoft stock is up more than 30% year to date, largely as a result of its AI-related moves. CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed in Microsoft's recent quarterly conference call that the company is ""going to lead in the AI era.""

While Microsoft is well-known these days for its AI leadership, it's easy to forget that the company offers a dividend, but its yield of under 0.9% isn't anything to get excited about. However, Microsoft has increased its dividend for 13 consecutive years. It's also in a strong financial position to keep that streak going.

3. Apple

Apple (AAPL 1.41%) reigns as the largest company in the world, based on market cap. But the huge technology company doesn't get much attention these days for its AI expertise or its dividend.

The company's Siri virtual assistant is still one of the most widely used AI tools, although it seems dated after the introduction of ChatGPT. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently stated that the company ""view[s] AI as huge.""

He added that Apple plans to ""continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis."" Recent staff recruiting by the company indicates that it's accelerating its efforts in multiple areas of AI development.

Apple's dividend is the lowest of these three AI stocks, with a yield of under 0.6%. But the company has increased its dividend every year since initiating the program in 2012. Apple also has plenty of financial flexibility to continue boosting its dividend payout in the future.

Are they buys?

My view is that all three of these AI dividend stocks are solid picks, depending on your investing style. Income investors will probably like IBM the most since it pays the most attractive dividend. Growth investors will be more interested in Apple and Microsoft, both of which should be able to capitalize on the AI boom in the coming years."

: Did Nvidia just help create an AI-fueled stock bubble?,MarketWatch,2023-05-26T20:25:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/did-nvidia-just-help-create-an-ai-fueled-stock-bubble-ef607f51,"Tech stocks have roared back, but the current mania for artificial intelligence appears to expect too much too soon, which creates the possibility of a bubble.

Amid a first quarter of mostly mediocre growth and little in the way of guidance for the second half of the year, there was a lot of hype and hope about the future impact of AI. Big Tech stocks added more than $2 trillion in market capitalization in the first quarter, much of that based on hopes for the future and on some of these stocks now being viewed as havens in an economic storm.

Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +2.54% seemed to justify the investment this week, stunning Wall Street with a whopping projection for its next quarterly revenue target, fueled in part by sales of Nvidia chips to power AI-driven data centers. Those gains rippled throughout the tech sector, as investors were excited to see any company put some actual numbers on this frightening and awesome technology.

The theory would be that after that money surges into Nvidia, it will soon move to the companies buying the tech from Nvidia in order to live up to their AI hype. But that may not happen for years. Much of the tech sector will be in investing and spending mode for a while — which is great for Nvidia, but not a guarantee that other tech companies will soon see the same returns.

“It is somewhat unique to Nvidia,” said Daniel Newman, principal analyst and founding partner at Futurum Research. “Not only it is an arms race, it is a supply race. It’s pretty safe to say that the hyperscalers are leading this, then the biggest enterprises are next. They are trying to get their hands on every system they can get. They don’t know entirely why yet, they just know they need all the computing power they can get, every scrap of inventory they can get their hands on.”

More from Therese: Nvidia CFO on record-breaking forecast: ‘The inflection point of AI is here’

Newman likened the current spending spree on AI systems to building a structure when steel is in short supply. “So they are buying all the steel they can get their hands on and just laying it down on the job site.”

The rebound in tech stocks has pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +2.19% out of the bear market it entered last year, but there is little evidence from the recent spate of earnings reports that growth has returned to the levels that justified tech’s pricey valuations. Investors seem to be betting on the unproven theory of a second-half rebound and near-term results from AI, while much of the tech sector — that is, just about every company not named Nvidia — still has a lot to prove about their near-term results and how AI will benefit their bank accounts.

Did earnings justify the tech-stock rebound?

As tech earnings season nears an end, we have seen stocks rise more than the results. The combined results from Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.87% GOOGL, +0.92% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.44% , Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.41% , Meta Platforms Inc. META, +3.70% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.14% showed only slight revenue growth of 4% in the first calendar quarter, with total revenue of $373.2 billion, rising from $358.7 billion a year ago. That paltry 4% revenue growth pales in comparison with the double-digit growth of quarters past.

Net income fared slightly better, rising 7.5% to a combined net of $66.4 billion, up from $61.7 billion a year ago, but per-share earnings for Big Tech fell 5.3% from the same period in 2022 as companies continue to grow their share counts through stock compensation. Big Tech has so far outpaced the overall S&P 500 in revenue growth but saw a sharper decline in EPS.

Don’t miss: After a $2 trillion stock rebound, Big Tech wades into sea of uncertainty

Investors and analysts were still relieved by those results. After a $2 trillion rebound in the first quarter, shares of four of the top five companies were trading on average about 40% higher year to date, with Meta stock more than doubling as Wall Street applauded its massive cost-cutting moves. Both Alphabet and Apple hit 52-week highs last week. Nvidia, now close to reaching $1 trillion in market cap, may join the ranks of Big Tech soon, but it is not included in this data.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the quarter “a much better-than-feared earnings season for tech.” Overall strength in cloud computing helped Microsoft beat estimates amid a huge decline in the PC market, but Amazon signaled some concerns about AWS. A more stabilized internet advertising market helped Alphabet’s Google search and ad business. Meta saw its earnings decline, with only slight revenue growth, as the Facebook parent cut costs, but it gave a better-than-expected forecast. Apple saw a surprise jump in iPhone sales, fueled in part by strong performance in emerging markets.

“ ‘The economy has shown incredible resiliency over the past two quarters despite huge issues such as a banking crisis. Yet it’s quite possible that the wheels could fall off the bus with [third-quarter] earnings.’ ” — Maribel Lopez, Lopez Research principal analyst

“We were told it was going to be horrible, the market was going to crater, and what we saw was that tech is going to be more resilient,” Futurum’s Newman said.

Results from the largest tech companies papered over some overall weakness, however. According to Credit Suisse’s senior equities strategist, Manish Bangard, earnings for all tech companies included in the S&P 500 have underperformed when compared with the overall S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% .

Two weeks ago, with 85% of companies having reported, Bangard noted that revenue growth for S&P 500 companies was 3.7% and EPS was down 2.4%, while tech companies in the index saw revenue fall 3.1% and EPS fall 12%. The data did not include results from Nvidia and several others that reported this week.

The first quarter also saw many companies meeting or beating lowered expectations, and estimates are still being cut. According to FactSet and a MarketWatch analysis, analysts have cut their earnings estimates for half of the 72 tech companies in the S&P 500 since December. They have also cut estimates for 44 of those companies for 2024.

More from Therese: The streaming wars are destroying all that was good about streaming

As this column noted last month, the first-quarter earnings season for some tech companies was expected to be buoyed by cloud-computing projects, with one analyst noting she was worried about the summer.

“The economy has shown incredible resiliency over the past two quarters despite huge issues such as a banking crisis,” Maribel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research, said in a recent email. “Yet it’s quite possible that the wheels could fall off the bus with [third-quarter] earnings. We see softening demand in areas such as retail, housing etc., which can’t be good for the overall economy.”

Indeed, the macroeconomy, jitters about the state of some regional banks and a looming debt-ceiling crisis are adding uncertainty to the mix, with some companies such as Apple citing macroeconomic uncertainty as the reason they are not giving much of a forecast. None of the Big Tech companies have provided a full annual forecast, with many executives citing the uncertain economic environment for the lack of more guidance.

Even Nvidia, which made the markets move with its forecast, declined to give guidance beyond the current quarter. When MarketWatch asked Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress directly about her view beyond the current quarter, she would only say, “We have procured a substantial supply for the second half of the year. We have better visibility for a few quarters out. That is about as much as we can articulate now.”

Generative AI is now the ‘all-weather sport’

Newman noted that while investors are concerned about the macroeconomy, tech in many cases is going to be more appealing, especially now with the massive focus on AI. And Nvidia’s monster projection showed the promise of the technology.

Newman described the focus on generative AI as an “all-weather sport.” He also believes that generative AI, because it is being tested by the public in applications like Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, will be a great democratizer.

“It is being made available to companies smaller than ever before,” he said. “AI is going to find its way into companies, and it’s going to be the fastest disruption we have seen.”

On top of software companies like Microsoft MSFT, +2.14% and Alphabet’s Google that are offering AI embedded in search, tech firms ranging from chip makers to hardware makers to telecom companies will all eventually benefit from a big wave of investment in the technology, Newman noted. “When generative AI is done on the edge, that will force another wave of upgrades,” he said, referring to the eventual processing of AI queries on devices instead of in the cloud.

Quarterly reports were in some cases overshadowed by talk about artificial intelligence, but investors should know that the costs will arrive well before the benefits. Microsoft executives, for example, talked about higher capital spending on AI efforts. Alphabet too talked about higher spending for its data-center infrastructure, with AI also a part of that spending.

This is where the possibility of a bubble exists. While investors are betting that other companies will soon see the same type of returns on AI that Nvidia expects this quarter, those companies may actually be shipping their money to Nvidia in hopes of getting a return years down the line. Wall Street expects earnings and revenue growth to turn around in the second half of the year, but if most of the tech sector is focused on spending to build for the future, that will not happen.

So while AI captured the most attention from investors this earnings season, especially after the Nvidia euphoria, they need to remember that there could be turbulence for the next few quarters. And spending on AI itself is going to mean a big investment cycle before some rewards are seen. Meanwhile, regulators are looking at whether they can put any guardrails on AI applications at this point.

Big Tech may be a haven for investors right now, with some caveats. As Newman pointed out, there has been a disproportionate flow of money into the big names, because “they have the most competitive technological moats.”

That applies to long-term bets, though. If Wall Street estimates are any indication of the rest of the year, they are pointing generally to continued lowered expectations. And if the numbers we see the rest of the year fail to compare to Nvidia’s monster forecast, the trillions poured into tech so far in 2023 could disappear just as fast."
Here's How Much Warren Buffett's 4 Big Stock Buys Just Boosted Berkshire Hathaway's Dividend Income,Motley Fool,2023-05-24T08:57:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/heres-how-much-warren-buffetts-4-big-stock-buys-ju/,"Warren Buffett is a big believer in dividend-paying stocks. Even though the company he leads, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.55%) (BRK.B 0.49%), doesn't pay dividends, many of the businesses in which it invests feature extensive dividend income.

Berkshire Hathaway recently announced its latest individual stock holdings through its 13-F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing revealed changes to Berkshire's portfolio during the first quarter of 2023, and during that period, Berkshire added shares of several notable dividend payers. By doing so, Berkshire boosted its potential annual dividend income by more than $80 million. Here's the breakdown.

HP: $17.3 million extra

Computer printer and hardware company HP (HPQ 1.29%) has quietly become a major position in Berkshire's portfolio. With almost 121 million shares of HP, Berkshire owns about 12% of the tech business, with a value of about $3.5 billion based on recent prices. Berkshire just bought an additional 16.48 million shares during the first quarter of 2023.

HP pays its shareholders $0.2625 per share in dividends each quarter, which works out to a yield of more than 3%. The position in the printer specialist pays out about $127 million in dividends, and the shares that Berkshire just bought will add $17.3 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire.

Apple: $19.6 million extra

Berkshire's largest individual stock holding by far is Apple (AAPL 1.41%). The conglomerate holds a roughly 5.8% stake in the iPhone maker, and the market value of the 915 million Apple shares it owned as of March 31 was more than $150 billion. Buffett made an incremental purchase of 20.42 million shares of Apple stock during the period.

Apple's dividend yield of just over 0.5% isn't all that impressive, but it still puts plenty of cash into Berkshire's coffers. At $0.24 per share each quarter, Apple's dividends amount to nearly $879 million in annual income. The added shares purchased just in the first three months of 2023 should add more than $19.6 million in cash over the next year -- and that's assuming that the tech company doesn't boost its payout even further in the interim.

Bank of America: $20 million extra

Yet beating out Apple in the dividend department is Bank of America (BAC 0.50%). Berkshire added 22.75 million shares of BofA stock during 2023's Q1. With a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, that should contribute just over $20 million in additional dividend income annually. Berkshire's total position of 1.033 billion shares generated about $909 billion in dividends.

Buffett has actually sold off many of Berkshire's bank stock holdings recently. But Bank of America remains a favorite, and even though the total market value of Berkshire's BofA position is under $30 billion, the 3.1% dividend yield is much higher than Apple's, allowing the bank stock to cement its position as a leading contributor of dividend income for the Buffett-led insurance giant. Berkshire also controls about 13% of BofA's outstanding shares, which shows the confidence that the Oracle of Omaha has in the Charlotte-based banking giant.

Capital One Financial: $23.8 million extra

Continuing the bank theme, Berkshire added shares of Capital One Financial (COF 2.93%) for the first time during 2023's Q1. Purchases of 9.922 million shares represent just a 2.6% stake in Capital One, but they represent nearly $1 billion in value.

Moreover, with a $0.60 per-share quarterly dividend, Capital One boasts a 2.4% dividend yield. With such a massive investment, Berkshire boosted its annual dividend income by more than $23.8 million. Given an inexpensive valuation, Buffett likely believes Capital One can rise in value at the same time that it keeps paying out dividend income.

Don't forget the dividends

Even if you don't need dividend income from your portfolio to pay for your living expenses, it can still be valuable to invest in dividend stocks. With the cash they pay out, you can make additional investments and increase your income even further. That's been a winning strategy for Warren Buffett , and it's one you should closely consider as well in your own investing."
"1 Super Stock That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the $1 Trillion Club",Motley Fool,2023-05-24T10:01:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/1-stock-apple-microsoft-amazon-alphabet-1-trillion/,"In 1901, United States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company. But by 1955, vehicle manufacturing was the largest creator of value, with General Motors beating every other company in the world to a $10 billion market capitalization.

There was another changing of the guard in 1995, when industrial conglomerate General Electric became the first-ever $100 billion company. It offered everything from financial services to household appliances.

The technology sector reigns supreme today. In 2018, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the first to amass $1 trillion in value, and it has since been joined by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG).

As you can tell, the $1 trillion club is very exclusive, and some companies are currently closer to joining than others. I'm going to reveal one that seems like a long shot, but it has a growing number of opportunities that could catapult it into those ranks.

Uber Technologies (UBER 1.32%) is worth just $79 billion today, so its stock will deliver a 1,116% return for investors if it grows to become a $1 trillion giant. Here's why I think it will.

Here's where Uber stands today

Uber operates in three segments: mobility (ride-hailing), food delivery, and commercial freight. It serves more than 130 million customers on its platform each month. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, they booked a whopping 2.1 billion trips across mobility and food delivery.

Uber is the undisputed global leader in ride-sharing, which is the largest driver of the company's revenue. And now it's using that expertise to build the world's largest logistics network as well, through its Uber Freight platform.

It's having some early success, with over $17 billion in freight under management from 200,000 customers so far. That's a drop in the bucket compared to its opportunity, though, which totals $884 billion in the U.S. trucking sector alone.

On the whole, Uber's business is doing great right now!

But Uber is about to enter a new multitrillion-dollar industry

Wall Street firm Ark Investment Management, which is led by popular technology investor Cathie Wood, thinks the future of ride-hailing is the driverless vehicle. It believes fully autonomous-driving vehicles will dominate the industry, and Ark Invest sees Tesla (TSLA 4.72%) delivering its first robo-taxi as soon as this year.

But Uber might already have the upper hand. It abandoned its in-house autonomous-driving segment in 2020 and partnered with a company called Motional in 2022 on a 10-year deal instead. Motional is a joint venture between South Korean automaker Hyundai (HYMTF 0.62%) and mobility technology company Aptiv (APTV 2.70%), and together they have built an advanced self-driving vehicle.

It has already achieved Level 4 capabilities, which means it can navigate and drive without any human intervention whatsoever.

Since Uber already has over 130 million monthly active users in its ecosystem, its transition to autonomous ride-sharing will be seamless. Competitors like Tesla, on the other hand, need to build their own software applications so customers can call a ride, and it could take years to acquire enough users to dent Uber's dominance.

Ark believes autonomous ride-hailing companies will generate $4 trillion in annual revenue as soon as 2027, creating $14 trillion in enterprise value in the process. It looks like Uber is in the driver's seat already.

Here is Uber's (mathematical) path to a $1 trillion valuation

Despite Uber's historical success and its potentially lucrative future opportunities, investors aren't giving its stock much credit. Based on the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $33.8 billion and its current market cap of $79 billion, the stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 2.3.

That's far below its peak of 8, which it achieved during the tech boom in 2020. For the sake of this thought experiment, let's assume the stock trades at an average P/S of 4 over the long term, which means it will have to generate $250 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.

Uber could get there by the year 2033 if it can grow its revenue by at least 22.1% annually between now and then. It's not out of the question considering the company has grown its revenue by 32% over the last five years despite a pandemic and a weak economy standing in the way.

Don't forget, Ark Invest believes companies in autonomous ride-hailing could generate $4 trillion in revenue as soon as 2027, which means Uber only has to capture 6.2% of that market to achieve $250 billion in that one segment alone! Since it already has a 37% global market share in ride-sharing overall, it should be a piece of cake.

Uber has a real shot at joining Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the $1 trillion club over the long run, and if it does, investors who buy the stock today stand to earn a whopping 1,116% return."
2 Dividend Stocks Putting More Money in Investors' Pockets,Motley Fool,2023-05-24T12:15:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/2-dividend-stocks-putting-more-money-in-investors/,"Are you a shareholder of either Apple (AAPL 1.41%) or ASML Holding (ASML 3.87%)? If so, congratulations: You recently became incrementally richer. As is their habit, both companies recently declared dividend raises. Still, while this means a bit more coin in the bank accounts of their investors, it doesn't necessarily mean either company is investment-worthy today.

So let's put Apple and ASML under the microscope and see if they pass inspection.

1. Apple

It's a little hard to imagine these days, but for the first few decades of its existence, Apple was basically a pure-play tech hardware company. It had a regularly refreshed lineup of personal computers that usually won praise for their quality and utility although the company never became a No. 1 producer of mass-market machines.

These days, of course, Apple is an electronics and consumer-goods powerhouse that has sprouted thick branches from that trunk of original computer tech. We see iPhones everywhere, and it's not unusual for a household to have more than a single iPad tablet. Ever bold, the tech giant has pushed confidently into other product categories such as smartwatches and even computer chips.

Apple has cleverly positioned itself as a broadening electronics retailer whose products all operate on the same software platform. With this, its mighty App Store draws billions of dollars in revenue from the software you and I have on our iDevices, be it purchase charges, in-store buys, or subscriptions. The iOS operating system will continue to be foundational, and those apps and commerce opportunities will keep coming.

The King of Cupertino has been on its throne for a long time now, but it still seems like it has plenty of growth in store. Across all of its fiscal 2022, Apple managed to increase its net sales by 8%, with net income improving by 5%.

Macroeconomic strains and supply issues have dinged 2023 results so far, but that should reverse in the next year. On average, analysts are modeling 6% growth on the top line for 2024 and, much better, almost 10% improvement in per-share net income.

So is it any wonder that Apple just pulled the trigger on yet another dividend raise? The new quarterly disbursement is $0.24 per share, 4% higher than its previous payout. This was paid on May 18.

While the enhanced amount doesn't make it the highest yielder on the scene (at under 0.6%), it represents the 11th straight raise for the company, which seems fully determined to keep rewarding its shareholders.

2. ASML

In contrast to the overly familiar Apple, ASML is quite the under-the-radar stock. Based in the Netherlands, the company produces the photolithography machines used to make computer chips. In fact, it's the sole maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) devices, the only machines that can produce certain types of advanced chips.

As you might imagine, this is a monster business in a world stuffed full of smart devices, servers, and computers. Enduringly strong demand for chips keeps pushing ASML's financials ever higher. In its first quarter, the company reaped $7.3 billion in revenue, a very high leap over the $3.8 billion a mere one year prior. Not to be outdone, net income came in nearly three times higher, at $2.1 billion, against $750 million from a year ago.

As a result, ASML is a highly profitable company that throws off a lot of cash. It likes to direct some of this to its shareholders, and recently it rewarded them with -- you guessed it -- a dividend raise. The company's quarterly payout now stands at 1.69 euros ($1.82) per share, a robust 23% higher than the 1.37 euros ($1.49) it was distributing previously.

ASML's dividend raise kicked in with the quarterly payout dispensed on May 10. At the most recent closing share price, the new amount yields just over 1%.

None of this is a fluke or a one-off. ASML is facing the ""good problem"" of being too popular -- to the point where at the end of the first quarter, its order backlog was an intimidating $42 billion. That's nearly double the revenue it earned in all of 2022. How's that for popularity? Particularly with an explosion in the appeal and prominence of artificial intelligence (AI), consumers' devices will need ever more computing power.

ASML is guiding for 25% growth on the top line for 2023 compared to the previous year. Profitability should continue to be strong, ringing in at a gross margin of around 50%. We can easily imagine more double-digit growth in future years. With that kind of potential, ASML looks like a great stock to own, and now looks like a good time to own it."
2 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2023 and Beyond,Motley Fool,2023-05-24T11:26:01Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/2-leading-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-2023-and-beyond/,"After a sell-off in 2022, tech stocks are on the rise this year. Markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) have caught the eye of Wall Street. These technologies have the potential to affect the futures of countless industries, from consumer tech to healthcare, machine learning, education, and more. As a result, this year is an exciting time to load up on the tech companies that are building the future.

Here are two leading tech stocks to buy in 2023 and beyond.

1. Advanced Micro Devices

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 5.55%) is one of the world's most in-demand chipmakers, and its stock is an increasingly attractive investment. Technological advances have made more powerful chips crucial to the development of several industries. As a result, demand for AMD's central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and data processing units (DPUs) could soar as tech continues to evolve.

The semiconductor company's chips have allowed it to partner with titans of the industry to strengthen and diversify its business. In 2020, AMD became the exclusive supplier of chips for two of the most popular game consoles, Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, the company's data center chips have attracted cloud giants like Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle as clients.

However, one of the biggest reasons to invest in AMD is the support it is receiving from Microsoft to expand its AI chip offerings. According to a Bloomberg report from May 4, the Windows company is bolstering AMD's AI presence through financing and providing engineering resources in an effort to create an alternative to Nvidia.

The partnership is promising because Microsoft is one of the biggest names in AI right now; it invested $1 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019 and another $10 billion this year. The alliance has allowed Microsoft to integrate the start-up's AI technology into several of its services, such as its Office productivity software, Azure, and search engine Bing. As a result, Microsoft could be an excellent guide to help bolster AMD's AI expansion.

The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, suggesting that there will be plenty of market share up for grabs as AMD develops in the sector. Meanwhile, AMD's forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.2 suggests its stock is still significantly undervalued, making it worth an investment this year.

2. Apple

Apple (AAPL 1.41%) is the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion, and it might seem as if the best time to invest in it has passed. However, the company's dominance across several areas of consumer tech and a booming services business make its stock worth considering.

Apple shares have climbed nearly 1,000% since 2013. The company's consistent growth has primarily stemmed from its ability to rise to the top of nearly any industry it enters. It has attained a leading market share in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones despite other tech companies controlling those markets before Apple entered the picture.

As a result, the iPhone company's expected venture into the VR/AR market next month is an exciting development. According to data from Statista, the VR/AR market is projected to hit $31 billion this year and grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2027. The sector is currently dominated by Sony and Meta Platforms with their respective headsets. However, Apple's new device will offer connectivity with its other products and is expected to feature an iPhone-like interface, which could go a long way in attracting consumers.

Moreover, Apple services (Apple TV+, Music, iCloud, Fitness+, and more) have become an increasingly lucrative way for the company to diversify its earnings and lean less on product sales in the event of a market downturn. The consistent rise of iPhone adoption has spurred its services business, with the segment's revenue rising 63% since the first quarter of 2020 and offering attractive profit margins of around 70%.

Apple has a reputation for consistent stock growth, making it one of the most reliable investments available. Bolstered by a potential venture into a new market, the company's stock is a stellar buy in 2023 and beyond."
3 Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy in 2023 and Beyond,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:54:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/3-best-metaverse-stocks-to-buy-in-2023-and-beyond/,"The metaverse is a digital realm that transcends our understanding of reality. In this three-dimensional universe, people immerse themselves in a virtual environment and connect with others in the digital world. The technology has captured the imagination of many tech companies that are striving to make the metaverse a reality.

Investing in metaverse stocks requires patience. Its development could take years before reaching its full potential. According to McKinsey, the metaverse has the potential to generate $5 trillion in value by 2030. Citigroup thinks the opportunity could be worth a staggering $13 trillion by the same year.

There are companies making strides in the space that could be at the forefront of the metaverse's massive opportunity. Here are three stocks you should consider buying today to take advantage of the huge potential of this industry.

1. Meta Platforms

Meta Platforms (META 3.70%) has made a considerable commitment to the metaverse, rebranding its business from Facebook two years ago. It has poured billions of dollars into chasing the metaverse through its Reality Labs segment.

The company offers its Meta Quest virtual reality devices and software and metaverse-related content through the Meta Quest Store. It offers a platform for people to engage in virtual experiences, from gaming to fitness to entertainment.

The Reality Labs segment has been working on exciting technologies but has been a significant drag on earnings for Meta. Last year the segment lost $14 billion and another $4 billion in the first quarter.

Investing in the metaverse will require significant capital investment and may not be profitable for several years. However, Meta's Family of Apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, provide significant cash flow. Last year, these segments showed a profit of $43 billion, along with another $11 billion in the first quarter.

Meta Platforms is committed to investing significantly in the metaverse, and its other businesses ensure it can continue to do so -- making it a solid metaverse stock to buy today.

2. Unity Software

Unity Software (U 2.14%) provides creators a platform to create 3D development tools, allowing them to create interactive 3D, augmented, and virtual reality experiences. It expects to play a significant role in expanding metaverse content in the coming years. The company estimates half of the world's mobile, console, and PC games are created with its game development engine.

It offers two products, Unity Personal and Unity Student, for free to content creators who are just getting started. The company generates revenue through subscriptions to its platform, support, and services, and connects advertisers with creators to monetize their content.

Last year, Unity's revenue of $1.4 billion grew 25% from the year before. However, the company has struggled to turn a profit and lost $919 million during the year. In the first quarter, revenue grew 56% from last year, but its net loss increased to $254 million.

Unity is in growth mode and is racking up losses as it faces near-term headwinds. The stock has a promising future as a key player in the metaverse and presents an attractive investment opportunity for those with a long time horizon. Its high valuation and lack of profits make it best suited for investors willing to wait out its near-term growing pains for potentially excellent long-term returns.

3. Apple

The final metaverse stock to buy is Apple (AAPL 1.41%). Analysts expect Apple to announce its virtual reality headset during its Worldwide Developers Conference, which will begin on June 5. If it does, this product would be a massive move for Apple to add to its already impressive line of products.

According to Gizmodo, Apple's VR headset would be very different than other offerings in the market today in terms of functionality, available apps, and price. The device would use mixed reality or a combination of augmented and virtual reality and is expected to cost around $3,000. The move would be significant for Apple, which is already a behemoth with its $2.7 trillion market capitalization.

Like Meta, Apple has several other highly profitable businesses that provide excellent cash flow, allowing it to invest in building VR and related apps. Apple is already a stellar company, and its potential role in shaping the metaverse with its products is another reason the stock is solid to buy and hold long term."
Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:45:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/is-it-too-late-to-buy-apple-stock/,"Apple (AAPL 1.41%) has been on fire in 2023, driven higher by the remarkable resilience of the iPhone and a recovery by a broad cross section of technology stocks. Shares of the iPhone maker are up 32% so far this year, more than four times the 7% gains of the S&P 500. This marks a reversal of fortune for Apple, as its stock lost roughly 27% last year.

The biggest contributor to its gains so far this year was Apple's better-than-expected financial results. Investors were surprised by just how well sales of the iPhone held up, which suggests that the struggling economy -- which has weighed on the stock -- could soon rebound.

What does this mean for those who missed out on Apple's current rally? Is now the time to buy in expectation of additional gains or avoid the stock due to its valuation and the economic volatility that remains? Let's take a look.

What's been weighing on Apple stock?

It's no secret that the principal driver of stocks and the broader market indexes during the past year or so has been the current economic conditions. The bear market was fueled by 40-year-high inflation and the resulting interest rate hikes designed to keep higher prices at bay. The economic uncertainty caused a pullback in consumer spending, which has resulted in slowing sales of the iPhone -- Apple's biggest seller.

This was clear in Apple's performance in fiscal 2022 (ended Sept. 24, 2022). Full-year revenue grew just 8%. While still respectable, it was a far cry from the 33% gains the company generated in 2021. As alarming as this might be for some investors, it's important to note that this is typical of a downturn. History is clear that when the economy begins to recover -- as it no doubt will -- consumers will return to normal spending habits, which will most likely include upgrading to the latest Apple device.

This suggests that pent-up demand could drive Apple stock higher once consumer discretionary spending returns to normal.

What (else) could drive Apple stock higher?

In addition to a recovery in consumer spending, there are other catalysts that could fuel Apple's stock rally.

The tech giant has a large and growing cadre of active devices -- and that number continues to grow. Earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook revealed that Apple had amassed an installed base of 2 billion active devices while also hitting new all-time highs in each of its major product categories.

This translates to more revenue for the company, the result of its growing ecosystem. For example, iPhone users tend to visit the App Store, spending money on apps. They also avail themselves of other services, like paying using Apple Pay, streaming Apple TV+, or subscribing to Apple Music. Each of these apps makes Apple's ecosystem stickier, increasing the likelihood that not only will users stay around, they will also choose from the company's growing list of services -- thereby boosting revenue.

Another potential opportunity is Apple's long-rumored mixed-reality headset, which is expected to combine elements of virtual reality with augmented reality. While the company has yet to confirm the existence of this as-yet-to-be-released product, several major news outlets have suggested the device will be introduced during Apple's developer conference on June 5. Estimates vary widely regarding the expected price for the device, but most reports suggest a cost of about $3,000, with sales of about 1 million during the first year of release.

The jury is still out regarding the potential demand for such a product, but Apple has a strong track record of creating demand for products that many believed would be flops -- including the iPad and Apple Watch.

Apple is also expanding its presence in a number of emerging markets. The company just launched its online store in Vietnam and recently opened its first retail store in India, the world's second-largest smartphone market. These moves will help Apple tap into new and lucrative opportunities.

How to approach Apple stock now

Apple is currently selling for roughly 22 times trailing earnings, a lower valuation than the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 sported by the S&P 500. That's a pretty reasonable price to pay for a company with a strong history of growth.

As I illustrated above, Apple has a number of growth drivers that could spark a continuing stock rally over the longer term. Experienced investors with the discipline to withstand a little volatility should consider buying Apple now or adding to a position, particularly given the company's track record and the long runway ahead."

Meta Platforms, Inc (NYSE: META) tasted defeat in a lawsuit with European Union regulators who ordered vast amounts of data to help build an antitrust case against the Facebook parent.

On Wednesday, the EU General Court, the bloc's second-highest court, ruled that Meta had failed to prove that the request ""went beyond what was necessary,"" Bloomberg reports.

The case dates back three years to when the European Commission started examining Meta's sales platform and how it uses app data.

While Meta says it cooperated and handed over a million documents, the company prosecuted the EU's executive arm in 2020, citing the comprehensive nature of the data requests.

In 2020 the EU court ordered the EU to work with Meta and store information in a virtual data room.

Scrutiny of Meta added to EU probes into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN) mode of data collection from retailers, which by now was settled, and investigations into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) app store.

Apple : que se passe-t-il avec les écrans d’iPhone ?,Freenews.fr,2023-05-24T06:00:00Z,https://www.freenews.fr/freenews-edition-nationale-299/apple-que-se-passe-t-il-avec-les-ecrans-diphone,"Au milieu de l’anticipation croissante pour les futurs modèles d’iPhone d’Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), une déclaration récente de l’analyste renommé Ming-Chi Kuo suggère une situation potentiellement difficile pour les expéditions de Display Driver Integrated (DDI) de Novatek.

Il se passe quoi réellement ?

Lundi, Kuo, analyste chez TF International Securities, a révélé les perspectives du fournisseur d’Apple, Novatek, de manière assez surprenante, soulignant que les livraisons de composants DDI (Display Driver Integrated) pour iPhones seront potentiellement inférieures aux prévisions de l’année prochaine.

Kuo a imputé le déclin attendu à la prudence d’Apple dans l’ajout de nouveaux fournisseurs DDI, ce qui a entraîné une position conservatrice et pourrait avoir un impact sur le rôle de Novatek dans la chaîne d’approvisionnement de l’iPhone.

La réduction estimée des expéditions d’iPhone DDI de Novatek pour 2024 devrait dépasser 30%, ce qui pose un défi considérable à l’entreprise et fait penser aux réductions qui ont été opérées par Samsung sur certaines de ses filières de production, de l’ordre de 30% il y a encore quelques mois.

Kuo a également mis en lumière les défis auxquels sont confrontées les marques de smartphones Android.

Android, propriété d’Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) est en effet le premier système d’exploitation pour smartphones, avec une part de marché de 71,1%, devant iOS d’Apple, qui détient une part de marché de 27,6%.

Pourquoi c’est important

Apple a vendu pour 42,6 milliards de dollars d’iPhones l’année dernière au quatrième trimestre, soit moins que les 43,4 milliards de dollars attendus par les experts. Cependant, en annonçant les résultats et les revenus du quatrième trimestre d’Apple, le PDG Tim Cook a déclaré qu’il ne s’agissait pas d’une baisse de la demande ou des dépenses des consommateurs, mais de problèmes de chaîne d’approvisionnement.

Les résultats financiers d’Apple pour le quatrième trimestre de 2021 ont également été inférieurs aux attentes, le géant de la technologie ayant été confronté à des problèmes avec sa chaîne d’approvisionnement qui ont eu un impact sur les ventes d’iPhone, entraînant une baisse des revenus."
3 Once-in-a-Generation Buying Opportunities for Patient Investors,Motley Fool,2023-05-23T10:00:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/23/3-once-in-a-generation-buying-opportunities-for-pa/,"Legendary investors may have different strategies and preferences. But one thing that all great investors have in common is the coveted multibagger -- a position that increases several-fold over time.

We tend to think of multibaggers as small companies that have plenty of room for exponential growth. But multibaggers can also be hiding in plain sight. For example, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) began loading up on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock in 2016. Over the last seven years, Apple stock is up a staggering 650% even though Apple was established when Berkshire began buying shares.

Deere & Company (DE 0.66%) and PTC (PTC 0.08%) are similar in that they are well-known, arguably undervalued positions that could become multibaggers over time. On the other hand, Joby Aviation (JOBY -1.65%) is a smaller company that falls more into that traditional ""hidden gem"" category. Here's why all three stocks could help foster generational wealth for patient investors.

Greener pastures ahead for Deere stock

Daniel Foelber (Deere): Despite Deere putting up quarter after quarter of impeccable results, investors remain skeptical about the company's sustained success. That skepticism has cast a cloud over Deere, which has seen its stock tumble as of late. However, context is key, as Deere is still up big over the last few years, trouncing the performance of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.

Deere reported a monster quarter on Friday, May 19, crushing top- and bottom-line expectations. The report was initially met with optimism before Deere stock began selling off, representing a volatile day of trading where the stock swung by over $31 per share from peak to trough.

Deere stock is beginning to look too cheap to ignore and is arguably one of the best low-risk opportunities out there today. Deere's updated guidance calls for a staggering $9.25 billion to $9.5 billion in net income for fiscal 2023. To say that Deere is enjoying a favorable time in the cycle would be an understatement.

In fiscal 2021, Deere's net income more than doubled in a single year to $5.96 billion, eclipsing its previous all-time high net income of $3.54 billion all the way back in fiscal 2013. Deere followed up fiscal 2021 with a new record of $7.13 billion in fiscal 2022. It was a good run, and even Deere was initially cautious about its outlook in fiscal 2023. But its updated guidance illustrates Deere's combination of pricing power, industry leadership, and ability to capitalize on a great time in its end markets.

This fiscal year, Deere is on track to make an amount of money that used to take three or four years to make. If it hits even the low end of its goal, Deere will make more net income in the three-year period from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 than it did in the prior eight years combined.

These outsized profits could benefit investors in the short term through dividend raises and stock repurchases. But longer term, Deere will have even more dry powder to fuel its investments in sustainability, automation, and artificial intelligence.

Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 11.6, Deere stock is inexpensive. Although cyclical stocks tend to have low P/E ratios at the top of a cycle, Deere's valuation is particularly low and leaves a nice margin of error for the stock to remain cheap even if earnings fall.

All told, Deere has the makings of a lifelong investment for patient investors.

Take flight with Joby

Scott Levine (Joby Aviation): It's not everyday that the transportation industry is disrupted. But that's exactly what Joby is flying toward. Over the past 10 years, the company has developed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft which will be used to provide ride-sharing services for up to four passengers at a time. This innovative approach to transportation may seem like a pie-in-the-sky idea, but Joby is making real progress in executing its plan, and investors have a great opportunity to hitch a ride with the growth stock.

Nearly complete with the third of five stages in the Federal Aviation Administration's certification process, Joby plans on producing the first aircraft in 2023 that will adhere to the standards and design guidelines for the aircraft, which will be used for commercial operations. Should Joby remain on schedule with its development, it will commence commercial operations in 2025.

While the company's operations haven't taken off yet, it's still garnering considerable attention from a variety of sources. Providing a $55 million contract extension to Joby, the United States Air Force expects to receive two of Joby's eVTOL aircraft in 2024. In total, the U.S. Air Force's contract with Joby is valued at $131 million.

In addition to customers, Cathie Wood has taken note of Joby's potential. The Ark Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF has consistently picked up shares in March and April, adding another 719,904 shares in May.

Still in the early phase of its development, Joby won't start generating revenue until 2025 if everything goes according to schedule. Consequently, only those committed to exercising patience -- and comfortable with a more speculative investment -- should consider hitching a ride with the disruptive ride-sharing company.

This growing company is only just getting started

Lee Samaha (PTC): The fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0, is real, and it pays investors to get early exposure to the theme. The grandiose title refers to the fusion of the physical and digital worlds in the industrial world. Digitally connecting the physical and digital world allows the latter to iteratively analyze, model, and improve behavior in the former. For example, think of a manufacturing plant digitally modeled to predict failures in service equipment sooner.

Digitization plays across all of PTC's solutions. For example, instead of its computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software being used to design a part for an airplane, digitization allows the CAD/CAM user to redesign, analyze, and model a new version of the part before it's produced.

PTC's product-lifecycle management (PLM), an area in which PTC is the clear market leader, digitally manages the physical world. At the same time, its Internet of Things (IoT) software connects the physical and digital worlds. Finally, augmented reality (AR) solutions help optimize performance.

It's a compelling mix of technologies, and it is the future of industrial manufacturing -- a viewpoint backed up by PTC's expectation for 22% to 24% growth in annual run rate (ARR) in 2023. ARR refers to the ""annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software, cloud, SaaS, and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period.""

While a valuation of 27 times the estimated free cash flow (FCF) for 2023 may seem high, note that the Wall Street consensus calls for 28% annual FCF growth over the next few years. If PTC hits these targets for FCF (it raised its full-year 2023 FCF guidance on its last earnings call), the current share price could look like a great buying opportunity."
"Apple May Be Warren Buffett's Best Business, but It's Not His Favorite Stock to Buy -- This Is",Motley Fool,2023-05-24T09:06:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/apple-warren-buffett-not-his-favorite-stock-to-buy/,"Although Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.55%) (BRK.B 0.49%) isn't much of a household name, its CEO, billionaire Warren Buffett, certainly is. Since taking the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha has doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the S&P 500 (19.8% versus 9.9%). This substantial long-term outperformance is what coerces more than 30,000 investors and shareholders to trek to Omaha, Nebraska, every year to listen to Warren Buffett speak.

The latest Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting didn't disappoint. The traditional five-hour question-and-answer session that Warren Buffett and executive vice chairman Charlie Munger grant members of the audience usually results in invaluable nuggets of wisdom being passed along, as well as gaining added insight into Buffett's investment/analysis process.

Perhaps the biggest reveal during the 2023 annual meeting was the Oracle of Omaha's true feelings about tech stock Apple (AAPL 1.41%), which is a pillar for Berkshire Hathaway, but technically isn't the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy.

""A better business than any we own""

On one hand, all you have to do is pull up any of Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs to get a feeling for how Buffett and his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, ""feel"" about Apple. As of last week, Apple accounted for more than 47% of Berkshire's $333 billion of invested assets. This includes the more than 20 million additional shares of Apple added during the first quarter by Buffett and his team.

However, the Oracle of Omaha made sure not to mince his words when challenged about the idea of Apple accounting for a potentially dangerous share of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets during his company's annual meeting. Said Buffett:

But Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire's portfolio includes the railroad, the energy business, Garanimals, you name it, See's Candy. They're all businesses... They're good businesses. And to think that our criterion -- our criteria for Apple is different than the other businesses we own, it just happens to be a better business than any we own. And we put a fair amount of money in it, but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad. And Apple is a better business. Our railroad is a very good business. It was not remotely as good as Apple's business.

To be sure, Apple has checked all of Buffett's key points for some time. He certainly trusts the management team, which is headed by CEO Tim Cook. Not only is Apple continuing to lead the charge with the physical products that endeared the company with consumers (iPhone and Mac), but it's evolving with new subscription services. Apple's services segment should help the company minimize revenue fluctuations associated with iPhone replacement cycles, as well as bolster its operating margin over time.

Buffett also appreciates the value of a well-known brand. Apple is pretty consistently at or near the top of the list when it comes to brand value, and its customer base has proven exceptionally loyal. Subscription services should only enhance the loyalty of the company's customers.

And, of course, Warren Buffett's best business believes in rewarding its long-term shareholders. Apple is parsing out one of the largest nominal-dollar dividends among publicly traded companies, and it's repurchased a jaw-dropping $586 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. Not including itself, Apple has spent more buying back its stock since 2013 than the market caps of 493 out of the other 499 S&P 500 companies.

Move over, Apple! This is Warren Buffett's undisputed favorite stock to buy

But here's something you might not realize: Despite Buffett's love for Apple, it's not his favorite stock to buy. In fact, it's not even close.

Normally, perusing Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F filings will tell you everything you need to know about what Buffett and his investing lieutenants have been buying and selling. However, Berkshire's 13Fs aren't providing the complete picture regarding Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy (cue ironic music)... Berkshire Hathaway.

Prior to mid-July 2018, the Oracle of Omaha and his right-hand man Charlie Munger were only allowed to repurchase shares of their company's stock if it fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above book value). For more than a half-decade leading up to mid-July 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's stock never hit this mark, leading to no share buybacks.

On July 17, 2018, things changed in a big way. Berkshire's board passed new measures that gave Buffett and Munger significantly more discretion to buy back their company's stock. As long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet and both Buffett and Munger agree Berkshire's stock is trading below its intrinsic value, repurchases can be made with no ceiling or cap.

Since mid-July 2018, Buffett and Munger have overseen share buybacks every single quarter. During the recently ended first quarter, a little over 5,100 Class A shares were repurchased, along with close to 6.72 million Class B shares, which equated to almost $4.44 billion spent on share buybacks. In less than five years, Buffett has overseen the repurchase of $70 billion worth of his favorite stock, which is nearly double what's been spent purchasing shares of Apple since the beginning of 2016.

Since Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are an easy way to reward long-term investors. For starters, steadily buying back stock and lowering the outstanding share count increases the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. It's the same principle as Berkshire Hathaway becoming a large stakeholder in Apple without having to buy any additional shares.

What's more, buying back stock can have a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS). For businesses like Berkshire Hathaway that have steady or growing net income, a lower outstanding share count will provide a lift to EPS. Berkshire Hathaway is already a fundamentally attractive investment. Add on a stream of buybacks that boost its EPS over time, and it could become even more attractive.

Repurchasing $70 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock in less than five years is also a clear indication from Buffett and Munger that they're confident in the business they've built. Many of the companies Berkshire owns and has invested in are cyclical, which means they're poised to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.

Therefore, no matter how much the Oracle of Omaha praises Apple, there's absolutely no question that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy."
Microsoft and OpenAI are adding Bing to ChatGPT,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T15:00:10Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-and-openai-are-adding-bing-to-chatgpt-150010912.html,"Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI are getting a lot closer as the companies announced that Microsoft’s Bing search engine will now be a part of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The move, unveiled during Microsoft’s Build developer conference on Tuesday, means that the search engine could reach a wider audience of users and potentially drive greater market share for Bing.

The search engine will be available today for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, and available to free ChatGPT users in the near future via a plugin.

According to Microsoft CVP and Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi, the integration will mean ChatGPT will be able to provide more up-to-date answers to user queries than ChatGPT alone. ChatGPT doesn’t currently pull in new information from the web, but rather was trained on a specific dataset. That means the chatbot can answer questions about timely topics.

By adding Bing search to the bot, that should begin to change, making the bot more helpful.

It doesn’t hurt that adding Bing to ChatGPT will ensure that more users get access to Microsoft’s search engine. The platform, which the company revamped in the search engine in February, adding generative AI capabilities to the software and leaping ahead of market leader Google’s own search engine.

Since then, however, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has launched its own chatbot and debuted an experimental version of its search engine complete with generative AI functionality.

Microsoft isn’t hoping to dethrone Google overnight, though. The company has specifically said that it is looking to snatch small pieces of its rival’s market share at a time. According to Microsoft 1% of market share in the search market is worth roughly $2 billion.

Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

The Bing announcement comes less than a week after OpenAI revealed its ChatGPT app for iOS. The company says it’s also working on a version of ChatGPT for Android users.

In addition to adding Bing to ChatGPT, Microsoft also announced generative AI capabilities for Windows, known as Windows Copilot, as well as third-party plugins for its AI offerings, and the ability for enterprise customers to build their own chatbots using Microsoft’s Bing technology.

Google isn’t the only threat to Microsoft’s generative AI plans. Meta (META) is also investing heavily in the space, and, according to Fortune, Apple (AAPL) is staffing up for its own generative AI efforts.

Why Dish Stock Is Soaring Thursday,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-25T16:32:42Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dish-stock-soaring-thursday-163242527.html,"DISH Network Corp (NASDAQ: DISH) stock is up Thursday following reports of selling wireless plans for its nascent mobile phone service through Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The arrangement can potentially give the telecom company's 5G rollout a critical lifeline, the Wall Street Journal cites knowledgeable sources.

Dish stock's session volume reached 7 million vs. the average 100-day volume of 9.4.

Dish is already a customer of Amazon's cloud-computing services.

Also Read: Dish Comes Clean On February Hack: Affects Personal Info Of 300K Employees, Customer Details Unaffected

Dish voiced the need for Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone's operation on the company's new 5G network to tap the device's sizable market share.

Dish and its affiliates doled out $30 billion on mobile spectrum licenses, spending the past three years installing a nationwide network of cell towers and software with the latest 5G technology from scratch.

The potential deal allows Dish to market its service to millions of prospective customers and help Amazon expand its relatively small footprint in the consumer smartphone market.

Amazon has previously discussed potential wireless business deals with Dish.

Wireless plans sold through Amazon's e-commerce portal could eventually challenge rival cellphone carriers AT&T Inc (NYSE: T), Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ), and T-Mobile US, Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) as they battle slowing subscriber growth following a pandemic-era boom.

In May, Dish reported a first-quarter FY23 revenue decline of 8.6% year-on-year to $3.96 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $4.06 billion. EPS of $0.35 missed the consensus estimate of $0.36.

The net decrease primarily resulted from the decline in revenue from its Pay-TV Wireless and Wireless segments.

Price Action: DISH shares traded higher by 12.50% at $7.01 on the last check Thursday.

84% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 7 Stocks,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:06:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/84-warren-buffett-portfolio-invested-in-7-stocks/,"Compared to most investors, Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.55%) (BRK.B 0.49%) Warren Buffett is in a class of his own. The billionaire CEO of Berkshire who took over in 1965 has overseen a cumulative gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of nearly 4,100,000% as of last weekend. Jaw-dropping increases like this tend to get you noticed on Wall Street.

But what's truly interesting about the Oracle of Omaha is his transparency. Buffett is an open book who's willingly shared the traits he looks for in businesses when making sizable investment decisions.

However, the one factor that's made Warren Buffett successful which isn't given nearly enough attention is his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both he and right-hand man Charlie Munger believe that diversification is only necessary if you don't know what you're doing. Despite overseeing a nearly $339 billion investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett has 84% of invested assets tied up in just seven stocks.

1. Apple: $160.4 billion (47.3% of invested assets)

It takes one short look at Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio to realize the Oracle of Omaha willingly invests big bucks into the businesses he values most. Tech stock Apple (AAPL 1.41%) accounting for more than 47% of invested assets, and Buffett and his team adding to Berkshire's position during the first quarter, demonstrates just how highly he thinks of the company.

From brand value to innovation, Apple does it all. According to Interbrand and Kantar BrandZ's ranking, it's the most valuable brand in the world. Apple has an easily recognized brand, a loyal customer base, and is trusted by consumers. The Oracle of Omaha puts a lot of value into businesses that build trust with consumers.

Most importantly, CEO Tim Cook has allowed Apple's innovation to do the talking. The iPhone has been revolutionizing the smartphone market for nearly 16 years, and now Apple's subscription-services segment is rapidly adding new users.

The cherry on top for Apple is that it's repurchased $586 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. That's greater than the market cap of 493 out of 500 S&P 500 companies.

2. Bank of America: $29 billion (8.6% of invested assets)

Although Apple is viewed as Berkshire Hathaway's best business, there's no sector Warren Buffett is more comfortable investing in than financials. More specifically, he loves dabbling in bank stocks, with Bank of America (BAC 0.50%) being his very clear favorite of the lot.

The simple reason Buffett loves banks is because they're cyclical. Though recessions are inevitable, periods of expansion last considerably longer than downturns. This allows companies like Bank of America (BofA) to expand their loans and deposits (i.e., the bread and butter for banking growth) and grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy.

As I noted earlier this week, BofA's calling card is its sensitivity to interest rates. While the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades hasn't been pleasant for consumers, it's great news for BofA and the variable-rate loans it has outstanding. BofA is bringing in billions of dollars in added net-interest income each quarter thanks to higher interest rates.

Don't overlook BofA's capital-return program, either. During periods of economic expansion, BofA can comfortably return (with Fed approval) $20 billion to $30 billion annually to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.

3. Coca-Cola: $25.1 billion (7.4% of invested assets)

The third-largest holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio is Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held stock, Coca-Cola (KO -0.25%). Coke has been a fixture since 1988.

Coca-Cola is another perfect example of a wholesome brand Buffett likes that's built trust with consumers. It's one of the most recognized consumer-staples brands globally and has operations in all but three countries worldwide. Having this sort of geographic diversity, to go along with 26 brands generating at least $1 billion annually, provides the consistency of cash flow that Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) have grown to love.

Something else Coca-Cola has is an exceptional marketing team year in and year out. At the moment, Coke is spending more than half of its advertising budget online to connect with a younger audience. But don't overlook its decades of holiday tie-ins and well-known brand ambassadors, which allow the brand to engage consumers of all ages.

Coca-Cola has also increased its base annual dividend for 61 consecutive years, which is an easy way to get on Buffett's good side.

4. American Express: $23.2 billion (6.8% of invested assets)

Credit-services provider American Express (AXP 4.08%) is another long-term holding that's been a marvelous investment for Warren Buffett and his team. AmEx is a continuous holding since 1993, and Berkshire is currently sitting on an unrealized gain (not including dividends) of about 1,700%.

American Express's secret sauce is what I like to call its ability to ""double dip."" It's the No. 3 payment processor in the U.S. by credit card network-purchase volume, which allows it to generate merchant fees, and benefit as the U.S. and global economy expand. However, it also acts as a lender, which helps the company generate interest income and annual cardholder fees.

Furthermore, American Express is adept at attracting well-to-do clients. Consumers with higher incomes are less likely to change their spending habits when inflation rises or the U.S. economy hits a speed bump. Targeting high earners means fewer disruptions to its cash flow.

Since Berkshire's cost basis on AmEx is just $8.49 per share, its $2.40 annual dividend payout equates to a 28% yield relative to cost.

5. Chevron: $20.6 billion (6.1% of invested assets)

Despite trimming its position in this company by more than 30 million shares during Q1, Berkshire Hathaway's fifth-biggest holding is energy stock Chevron (CVX -0.31%).

The only reason Buffett, Combs, and Weschler would collectively agree to put more than $20 billion to work in an integrated oil and gas company is if they believe the value of energy commodities will remain elevated. Certain macroeconomic factors do suggest crude oil prices could be sticky at high levels. For instance, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, coupled with three years of capital underinvestment by energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic, should restrict the supply of oil for years to come.

On the flipside, Chevron is an integrated energy company, which is a fancy way of saying it's hedged its operating performance in the event that crude oil and natural gas prices sink. In addition to drilling, Chevron operates transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. The latter two tend to enjoy lower input costs and higher demand when crude prices dip.

To keep with the theme, Chevron is big on returning capital to its shareholders. It's increased its base annual payout for 36 years in a row, and its board recently approved a $75 billion share-repurchase program.

6. Occidental Petroleum: $12.9 billion (3.8% of invested assets)

Another energy stock the Oracle of Omaha and his team can't stop buying of late is Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.22%). Berkshire Hathaway was given the OK from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in August to acquire up to a roughly 50% stake in Occidental should it choose to do so.

The investment thesis for Occidental Petroleum somewhat mirrors Chevron in that higher oil prices are favorable, and both are integrated energy operators. However, there are two key differences. The first is that Occidental is far more reliant on its drilling segment as a percentage of net sales. If oil prices rise or fall, Occidental would be expected to see bigger swings in its operating cash flow and probably its share price.

The other big difference can be seen on its balance sheet. Whereas Chevron has one of the lowest net-debt ratios in the oil and gas industry, Occidental Petroleum closed out March 2023 with $19.6 billion in net debt. Even though that's down considerably from two years prior, it's still a sizable hole the company needs to dig itself out of.

I'd be remiss if I didn't also note that Berkshire Hathaway holds $10 billion worth of Occidental preferred stock that yields 8% annually.

7. Kraft Heinz: $12.7 billion (3.8% of invested assets)

The seventh and final company that collectively adds up to 84% of Warren Buffett's investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is consumer-packaged goods company Kraft Heinz (KHC 0.21%).

The lure for Kraft Heinz is the company's vast portfolio of well-known, easy-to-prepare meals, snacks, and condiments, such as Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and of course, Grey Poupon. Companies with strong branding typically have the ability to generate predictable cash flow and pay a handsome dividend -- a 4.1% annual yield in Kraft Heinz's case.

Kraft Heinz was in the minority in that it benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic. With people staying home during the pandemic, easy-to-make meals and snacks flew off grocery-store shelves.

But this organic sales boost has its limits. Despite having significant pricing power, Kraft Heinz's volume/mix has declined in successive quarters from the prior-year period. This looks to be a signal that consumers are trading down to cheaper brands, which could mean trouble for Kraft Heinz in the coming quarters."

政經方面，美國總統拜登和國會共和黨的代表週二結束了另一輪債務上限談判，但沒有任何進展。

美國財政部部長葉倫警告，債務上限「限制」了聯邦政府的支付能力，聯邦政府最快 6 月 1 日就無法再有足夠的資金來支付所有帳單，從而將導致違約，若成真，將打擊美國經濟並推高借貸成本。

共和黨週二質疑美債違約日是否像葉倫所說的那樣接近，這削弱提高債務上限的緊迫性，推動美股走勢向下。

儘管拜登和眾議院議長麥卡錫都對達成協議表示樂觀。麥卡錫週二告訴眾院共和黨員，債限談判還有一段路要走，懇求他們在共和黨削減開支的要求上保持團結，以避免美國違約，暗示談判的緊迫性和不確定性。

富國銀行認為，美國債務違約風險較低，因為兩黨都有提高債務上限的強烈動機，但持續辯論可能會增加固定收益和股市的波動性。

此前一天，聯準會 (Fed)「鷹王」、聖路易聯準銀行總裁布拉德 (James Bullard) 預估今年再升息 2 次。儘管布拉德鷹氣襲來，但約 88% 的交易員仍然認為聯準會將在 6 月暫停升息。

中國出手制裁美光後，共和黨籍眾院美中戰略競爭特別委員會主席蓋拉格 (Mike Gallagher) 週二 (23 日) 疾呼，美商務部應立即將中國 DRAM 龍頭長鑫存儲 (CXMT) 添加到實體清單中 (即貿易黑名單)，並確保美國技術不會受到任何影響。

MRB Partners 合夥人兼全球策略師 Phillip Colmar 稱：「當然，債務上限一直給投資者帶來壓力。協議可能在最後關頭達成，但如果協議能更早達成，我認為那將是令人鼓舞的。」

M&G Plc 股票和多元資產投資長 Fabiana Fedeli 認為：「美債違約可能性很小，因為民主黨和共和黨都不希望發生違約，但我們可能會接近違約和最後期限，離最後期限越近，投資人就越緊張，可能會轉向更安全的避風港，或許是長期美債。」

政經方面，美財政部長葉倫週三重申，美國財政部最快可能在 6 月 1 日耗盡現金，但很難確定具體哪一天耗盡現金。隨著人們越來越擔心美國可能出現歷史上的首次違約，她已看到金融市場存在一些壓力。

美國眾議院議長麥卡錫表示，他和美國總統拜登在打破債務上限僵局的諸多問題上仍存在很大分歧，共和黨已做出眾多讓步，不希望發生債務違約，已派談判代表前往白宮，希望在週三的會談中與民主黨會談取得進展。

聯準會發布的 5 月利率會議紀要顯示，官員們對是否支持進一步升息存在意見分歧、聯準會官員強調要依賴數據，而且今年不太可能降息。

該紀要提到，許多與會者強調需要在 5 月會議後保留選擇權，多位與會者表示，如果經濟按預期發展，可能不需要進一步收緊政策。

美國白宮國安會發言人柯比 (John Kirby) 週一 (20 日) 透露，白宮將與中國直接就中國制裁美光的行動展開對話，相信這不會對美中兩國關係構成重大影響。

德銀分析師 Jim Reid 指出：「確實有人​​擔心這可能會一直持續下去，投資人逐漸加緊準備，也有人在談論現在是否需要短期延期來解決債限問題，但就目前而言，麥卡錫繼續淡化這種可能性。因此，投資人繼續緊張地等待，目前還沒有出現達成協議的跡象。」

50 Park Investments 執行長 Adam Sarhan 表示：「隨著 6 月 1 日最後期限臨近，由於買超情況和對不利債務上限結果的擔憂加劇，市場仍下跌回落。當恐懼佔據上風時，投資人往往會先行拋售，然後再提出疑問，這就是我們可能看到的情況。」

Microsoft is letting companies build their own AI bots,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T15:00:03Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-is-letting-companies-build-their-own-ai-bots-150003881.html,"Microsoft (MSFT), on Tuesday, announced a new service that will allow enterprises to build their own AI-powered apps. Unveiled at Microsoft's annual Build conference, the offering, known as Azure AI Studio, is one of a slew of AI-based products the tech giant is rolling out as it seeks to become the go-to name in AI in Silicon Valley and beyond.

According to Microsoft, Azure AI Studio will allow companies to create custom apps using ChatGPT and GPT-4. Microsoft refers to these as apps as copilots, because in addition to capabilities found in the company's Bing Chat like searching for data on the web, copilots can be used to access and process a firm's unique data as well.

According to Eric Boyd, Microsoft CVP of Azure AI, a business with a number of different health-care plans could create a copilot that helps employees easily search for the appropriate plan for them. So if an employee is needs insurance that covers eyeglasses they'd be able to use the copilot to search for it using a natural language rather than having to read through pages of unrelated information.

Boyd offered a similar example of manufacturing giant Siemens using a copilot to help workers quickly gain access to and understand quality controls for their own products.

In addition to Azure AI Studio, Microsoft also announced that it’s bringing more plugins to its Bing chatbot. The company previously announced that it is adding plugins for WolframAlpha and restaurant site OpenTable, which will eventually allow you to book reservations from the chatbot.

Now Microsoft says it will also add plugins for services including Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Redfin, and Zillow. That could help turn Bing into a kind of one-stop shop for a number of tasks on the web.

Microsoft is in a heated race to be the top AI company among its Big Tech peers. The firm received a huge boost from its multi-billion investment in OpenAI, using the organization’s technology to power its own AI services.

The Windows maker has since announced AI-powered products for everything from its Microsoft 365 productivity suite to its various enterprise and cybersecurity offerings.

But rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) isn’t sitting idly by. The company, which helped come up with the technology OpenAI uses for ChatGPT, rolled out its own collection of new generative AI-powered offerings during its I/O develop conference on May 10.

Like Microsoft, Google is bringing generative AI capabilities to its enterprise productivity software Workspace, and opened up its Bard AI chatbot to the public. The company is also bringing plugins to Bard from companies including Instacart, Walmart, OpenTable, Kayak, Zillow, and others.

Microsoft and Google aren’t the only players, though. According to Fortune, Apple (AAPL) is looking to build out its own generative AI workforce, while Meta (META) is working on its own generative AI products.

Microsoft debuts AI assistant for Windows 11,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T15:00:55Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-debuts-ai-assistant-for-windows-11-150055094.html,"Microsoft (MSFT) is bringing its generative AI capabilities to Windows PCs. Unveiled during the company’s Build developer conference on Tuesday, the feature, called Windows Copilot, gives users access to an AI-powered bot directly from the Windows taskbar without having to launch a secondary program.

According to Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, Windows Copilot, which will launch in preview in June, will function across apps and allow users to do everything from looking up quick facts to completing more complex tasks.

“If I want to call my family in Cyprus, I can quickly check the local time to make sure I’m not waking them up in the middle of the night,” Panay explained in a statement. “If I want to plan a trip to visit them in Cyprus, I can ask Windows Copilot to find my family flights and accommodations for mid-winter break.”

The idea is for the app to function as a kind of all-purpose helper for Windows users. Panay says that the software will also work with Bing Chat and first and third-party plugins, meaning developers will be able to create additional ways for users to interact with the app.

Windows Copilot will also be able to control your PCs settings, so you’ll be able to ask it to do things like turn on Windows’ Focus Assist feature. It will also be able to summarize and compose text from other apps.

On Tuesday, the company also announced that it’s giving enterprise customers the ability to build their own copilots for their business purposes. According to Eric Boyd, Microsoft CVP of Azure AI, a company with a number of different health-care plans would, for instance, be able to create a bot that lets employees search for the one right for them that covers eyeglasses using a natural language search rather than having to read through pages of unrelated information.

Boyd offered a similar example of manufacturing giant Siemens using a bot to help workers quickly gain access to and understand quality controls for their own products.

Microsoft is in a race to become Silicon Valley’s go-to name in generative AI thanks to its multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI. But rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which helped develop the technology used by generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, isn’t far behind.

The company, like Microsoft, is offering its own generative AI chatbot known as Bard. And at its Google I/O developer conference this month debuted an experimental version of its search engine complete with generative AI capabilities.

Microsoft and Google aren’t the only big names looking to capitalize on the generative AI wave. Facebook parent Meta (META) is also developing its own generative AI software and Apple (AAPL), according to Fortune, is staffing up for a generative AI push.

Nvidia Is At The Door Of The $1 Trillion Club,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-25T16:43:34Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-door-1-trillion-club-164334000.html,"On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares soared 26% upon strong first quarter results and AI-powered guidance that both shattered expectations, bringing its market value at close to $755 billion. On Thursday during premarket trading, they surged even 29%, bringing the company’s market value to $980 billion and the chipmaker very close to joining, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the $1 trillion club.

First Quarter Figures

Total sales did drop 13% from last year’s comparable quarter when they amounted to $8.29 billion. But revenue of $7.19 billion still topped the expected $6.52 billion.

With surged demand for its data center offerings, the graphics chip specialist saw the unit’s revenue rise 14% YoY to $4.28 billion, leaving expectations of $3.9 billion far behind. This positive demand trend is owed to Nvidia’s GPU chips that large internet and cloud companies needed to train and deploy generative AI applications, like the one from Microsoft, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Even Apple is betting big on this front as on Tuesday, it revealed has partnered with Broadcom in a multibillion-dollar deal to develop chips made in the U.S.

On the other hand, Nvidia’s gaming division experienced a 38% YoY drop in revenue to $2.24 billion, but still topped expectations of $1.98 billion. However, it is important to note that gaming revenue did jump 22% from the prior quarter with the PC market still being in a slump. But, this segment remains as hot as ever, with even the tech titan Microsoft wanting to become a gaming powerhouse by committing $70 billion as it hopes to buy Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ: ATVI).

The automotive division remains a small part of Nvidia’s business with sales lower than $300 million, but with a YoY growth of 114%.

Net income amounted to $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, rising significantly from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $1.62 billion, or 64 cents.

AI-Powered Q2 guidance

Management is expecting revenue to grow 64% YoY to $11 billion. Although adjusted EPS were not provided, based on the given inputs, Motley Fool found they are expected to consequently skyrocket 286% to $1.97 a share. Microsoft who is leading the AI front for now is also betting big on this technology to fuel its revenue growth, but over the long-term as the tech titan gave a downbeat outlook due to slowed down cloud demand, a concern that it shares with its cloud peer, Amazon.

As it goes for the Moon, Nvidia already reached the stars

Given the challenging macroenvironment that caused even Amazon to be cautious and Microsoft to provide lackluster guidance, Nvidia not only did extremely well considering the circumstances by recording record revenue but also managed to give an exhilarating outlook. Nvidia already had good prospects based on gaming and cloud computing, but with generative AI, it’s long-term potential reached a whole new level. At a recent Goldman Sachs and SV Angel event on artificial intelligence, Bill Gates claimed that the power of this technology is so profound that could lead to people never needing to use Google or visit a website go shop like Amazon anymore. CEO Jensen Huang certainly thinks the Nvidia is in all the right places, with shares having more than doubled this year.

"Tuesday’s Top Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades: Apple, Conagra, CSX, Deere, DraftKings, Foot Locker, KeyCorp, Nike, Salesforce and More",24/7 Wall St.,2023-05-23T12:48:16Z,https://247wallst.com/investing/2023/05/23/tuesdays-top-analyst-upgrade-and-downgrades-apple-azul-conagra-brands-corteva-csx-deere-draftkings-foot-locker-keycorp-nike-salesforce-union-pacific-zions-bancorp/,"Tuesday's Top Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades: Apple, Conagra, CSX, Deere, DraftKings, Foot Locker, KeyCorp, Nike, Salesforce and More

The futures were lower on Tuesday, after the market started off the week going in multiple directions, with the Nasdaq pressing higher to close at 12,720 while the Dow Jones industrials sold off again, ending the day down at 33,268. The big winner was the Russell 200, which closed up 1.2% at 1,795.

The debt ceiling discussions remain on center stage, as President Biden flew back early from the G7 meeting in Japan to meet with the Speaker of the House. With the Treasury Secretary setting the June 1 “X-date” to lift the debt limit, there is now just over a week remaining before we run out of money. That, plus the likelihood of more Federal Reserve rate hikes, could put a damper on stocks.

Treasury yields were higher again across the board on Monday as the selling continued from last week. This comes after the dollar index posted another big gain last week. The 10-year note closed at 3.72%, while the short two-year paper finished the day at 4.32%. The inversion between the two is a sign of the potential for a recession.

Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude followed through on last week’s gains, as oil finished its best week in a month. Both of the benchmarks closed higher Monday, as analysts cited declining output from Iraq as a tailwind to open the week. Natural gas was the big loser in the energy complex on Monday, falling over 7% to finish Monday’s session at $2.40.



Gold closed flat on the day as the onslaught of selling seems to have abated. Analysts have questioned the current bullish stock stance, as central governments and institutions continue to load up on the bullion. Bitcoin finished the day modestly higher after a dreadful downdraft last week, closing at $26,898.

24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week with a goal of finding fresh ideas for investors and traders alike. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock. Consensus analyst target data is from Refinitiv.

These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Tuesday, May 23, 2023.

AnaptysBio Inc. (NASDAQ: ANAB): J.P. Morgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and trimmed its $31 price target to $30. The consensus target is $30.40. The shares were last seen Monday at $19.98, which was up over 4% on the day despite the downgrade.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): Loop Capital downgrade was to Hold from Buy. Its $180 target price is higher than the $178.88 consensus target. The stock closed on Monday at $174.20.



Azul S.A. (NYSE: AZUL): As BofA Securities upgraded the stock to Neutral from Underperform, it raised its $6.90 target price to $11, in line with the consensus target of $11.04. The stock closed almost 11% higher on Monday at $9.30 due to the upgrade and positive analyst comments."

〈美股早盤〉債務上限僵局令投資人不安 主要指數開低,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-24T05:53:51Z,https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/%E7%BE%8E%E8%82%A1%E6%97%A9%E7%9B%A4-%E5%82%B5%E5%8B%99%E4%B8%8A%E9%99%90%E5%83%B5%E5%B1%80%E4%BB%A4%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%8D%E5%AE%89-%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E6%8C%87%E6%95%B8%E9%96%8B%E4%BD%8E-135351359.html,"白宮和宮和黨代表就提高債務上限的新一輪談判未能取得突破，令投資人緊張不安，與此同時對全球經濟前景悲觀情緒日益加劇，美股主要指數周三（24 日）開低。

截稿前，道瓊工業指數下跌近 200 點或近 0.6%，那斯達克綜合指數跌近 90 點或 0.7%，標普 500 指數跌近 0.7%，費城半導體指數跌近 2%。

美國眾議院議長麥卡錫昨日表示，協議還沒有達成，但認為仍然可以在 6 月 1 日之前達成協議。據悉，雙方在支出方面仍存在重大分歧，目前沒有安排任何談判。據眾議院議長麥卡錫在當天的共和黨閉門會議上表示，他們離達成協議「還差得很遠」。評論稱債務談判的緊迫性因此大打折扣。聯準會（Fed）主席鮑爾與民主黨眾議員會面時對債務上限問題避而不談。

不過多家外媒援引知情人士消息指出，雙方將於美國時間周三上午重新談判，尋求就高美國 31.4 兆美元的債務上限達成協議，避免災難性的違約。

Fed 將於台灣時間周四兩點公布五月會議紀錄，投資人將密切關注 Fed 未來利率路徑的線索。該次會議上，Fed 進行此輪周期中的連續第十次升息，目前的焦點是 Fed 是否會在 6 月的會議上暫停升息。

Fed 主席鮑爾上周談話時提到，有鑑於近期一連串銀行倒閉造成信貸環境收緊，可能會暫停升息。然而，Fed「鷹王」布拉德日前表示，今年仍然需要在升息兩次，新「鷹王」卡什卡里也表示，Fed 應該在 6 月發出訊號，即便這此暫停升息也不意味著緊縮政策結束。

其他市場方面，英國通膨高燒難退，粉碎英國央行（BOE）暫停升息的預期。貨幣市場目前預估 BOE 的利率最高將達到 5.5%，這意味著年底前將整整升息 4 碼。

具體來看，英國 4 月消費者物價指數（CPI）年增 8.7%，高於預期 8.3%，前值為 10.1%，核心 CPI 年增 6.8%，高於預期與前值 6.2%。按月來看，4 月 CPI 成長 1.2%，高於預期與前值 0.8%，核心 CPI 成長 1.3%，也高於預期的 0.8% 與前值的 0.9%。

大宗商品方面，金屬價格普遍走低，倫敦交易所（LME）的銅庫存自 4 月中旬以來幾乎翻了一番，從這一點可以明顯看出銅需求疲軟。

截至台北時間周三（24 日）21 時許：

焦點個股：

蘋果 (AAPL-US) 早盤上漲 0.3%，至每股 172.07 美元

蘋果全球開發者大會（WWDC）將台灣時間 6 月 6 日至 10 日以線上方式舉行，開發者和學生有機會在開幕當天到加州 Apple Park 現場參加。其中今年 WWDC 最重要的主題演講定於台灣時間 6 月 6 日凌晨 1 點舉行，市場預估蘋果屆時將公布混合時境（MR）頭戴式裝置、15 吋 MacBook Air 以及 iOS、iPadOS、macOS 等一系列更新。

特斯拉 (TSLA-US) 早盤下跌 1.88%，至每股 182.27 美元

美國電動車龍頭執行長馬斯克日前表示，已向特斯拉董事會選定一位接班人，如果自己發生意外此人將接管公司，不過他並未透露這位接班人的姓名。特斯拉內部猜測，馬斯克屬意的下任特斯拉執行長很可能是目前的財務長 Zachary Kirkhorn。而近年來頗受馬斯克重用的高層，特斯拉中華區負責人朱曉彤也是可能的人選之一。

Alphabet(GOOGL-US) 早盤下跌 1.03%，至每股 121.30 美元

Alphabet 旗下 Google 日前發布一款新的對話式聊天機器人，它將協助廣告商製作廣告。Google 表示，廣告商可以輸入自己的網站，人工智慧（AI）聊天機器人將幫助草擬標題、選定特定關鍵詞和圖片來吸引消費者。

無

華爾街分析：

加拿大皇家銀行 Brewin Dolphin 市場分析主管 Janet Mui 表示，預估美國經濟將步入衰退，因為預期利率將維持在高處，對經濟和企業利潤都是負面影響。這一看法與市場目前定價背道而馳，市場認為有鑑於就業市場仍強凸顯美國經濟仍有彈性、Fed 升息腳步放慢，有望實現「軟著陸」。

貝萊德國際 EMEA 基本固定收益部門主管 Michael Krautzberger 也對美國經濟前景感到悲觀，他認為隨著債務上限最後期限逼近，該問題帶來的波動是看淡前景的原因之一，但預料不會出現技術性違約，會在最後一刻達成協議。

Stocks sink as debt crunch continues: Stock market news today,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T20:01:37Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-sink-as-debt-crunch-continues-stock-market-news-today-160957990.html,"US stocks closed lower Tuesday on Wall Street concerns that the debt-ceiling debate in Washington won't reach a resolution.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session down 1.12%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped 0.69%, or more than 200 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) declined more than 1.26%.

In Treasuries, yields moved lower across the curve Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield edged down to 3.7%. Two-year yields climbed to 4.34%, and those on the 30-year bond ticked lower to 3.95%. The extended losses came as worries over the debt-ceiling standoff intensified, as the prospect of a default moves closer.

Tuesday's negotiation talks initially provided some hope a deal could be reached. That followed optimistic remarks from President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy the previous day.

But McCarthy reportedly said in a closed-door meeting to Republican colleagues that ""we are nowhere near a deal yet"" hours after saying in the Oval Office ""I think, at the end of the day, we can find common ground.""

The back-and-forth has left investors on edge in the countdown to the June 1 ""X-date"", which is when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said a default is likely to come.

“Our base case remains that the debt ceiling ultimately does get lifted/suspended though the journey to that end could be at the eleventh hour and drive significantly higher market instability than appreciated by the market currently,” Dubravko Lakos, chief US equity strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note Monday.

“We expect a temporary/comprehensive deal on the debt ceiling to negatively impact federal spending and for a likely contentious budget negotiation process later this year,” Lakos added.

On the economic front, S&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 54.5 in May, up from 53.4 in April and better than the 53.0 estimated by economists, marking a 13-month gain for the index.

Separately, new single-family home sales rose 4.1% in April to an annualized pace of 683,000, above the revised rate of 656,000, according to a report from the Census Bureau. That's still 11.8% above the year-ago level and higher than the Bloomberg consensus expectations of 665,000 units for April.

In single stock moves, shares of Yelp Inc. (YELP) rallied over 5% as activist investor TCS Capital Management confirmed its stake in the company and asked the company to explore strategic alternatives including a sale, according to an open letter to the Yelp board of directors on Tuesday.

Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) shares gained more 2% after the home-improvement company cut its full-year sales forecast Tuesday, citing lower demand as high inflation impacts discretionary spending. While Apple (AAPL) said it has entered a multi-billion dollar deal with chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) to use chips made in the US. Shares of the tech giant slid more than 1%.

Elsewhere, shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) moved lower after the company topped its first fiscal quarter sales and earnings while maintaining its outlook for this year

Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM) shares dropped more than 7% after the videoconferencing software company posted a beat on their results for its fiscal first quarter. The company also raised its full-year guidance.

Shares of Pfizer Inc. (PFE) rose after a study showed positive weight-loss results for patients taking the drug maker’s oral diabetes treatment.

BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (BJ) shares declined more than 7% after the retailer reported revenue that came in below analysts' expectations. Comparable club sales not including gasoline were lower than anticipated.

In the meantime, Netflix (NFLX) is cracking down on password sharing in the US. The company broke the news in a blog post Tuesday afternoon.

After the closing bell, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), Intuit Inc. (INTU), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL) are expected to report results.

3 AI Stocks Warren Buffett Is Betting On,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-26T19:43:32Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ai-stocks-warren-buffett-194332954.html,"ardasavasciogullari / Getty Images

Warren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, hasn’t earned the nickname “The Oracle of Omaha” for nothing. His company’s stock doubled the annual return of the S&P 500 from 1965 to 2022, returning 19.8% on average annually vs. the S&P 500’s 9.9%.

In addition to his folksy wisdom, Buffett is also known for his general reluctance to buy tech stocks. But what may surprise some investors is that one popular tech stock — with important exposure to artificial intelligence — actually makes up nearly half of the Berkshire Hathaway investment portfolio, and the company has small stakes in other AI-related companies as well. Here’s a look at some of the prominent AI stocks that Warren Buffett is betting on.

Apple (AAPL)

When it comes to AI-related stocks — and tech stocks in general — Apple is really the beginning and the end of the discussion. After shunning tech stocks for decades, Buffett made a major shift on May 16, 2016, picking up nearly 10 million shares of Apple at a split-adjusted price of about $6.81.

Now trading at about $171 per share, Apple has posted huge gains on Buffett’s original purchase. Although Buffett has occasionally trimmed Berkshire’s Apple position, it now sits at a whopping 47% of the company’s entire investment portfolio.

Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?

Regardless of what other AI stocks Berkshire might dabble in, it’s clear that the company’s big bet is on Apple.

Buffett has said he views Apple not as a tech company but as a consumer products business. In that field, Buffett sees Apple as the best of the best. In fact, at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting in May 2023, Buffett said Apple “just happens to be a better business than any we own.” Regarding Apple’s iPhone, Buffett said that if people “had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they give up their second car.”

Apple already has begun integrating AI into its product line. CEO Tim Cook said AI will eventually “affect every product and service we have.” Two of the company’s signature products, the iPhone and the Apple Watch, already use an AI-powered crash detection feature, and the Apple Watch also has an electrocardiogram feature.

In its quest to continue its dominance in the consumer products world, Apple seems poised to rapidly integrate AI into its stable.

Amazon (AMZN)

Amazon is Berkshire Hathaway’s other primary bet in the tech/AI industry, although it’s a far cry from the company’s love of Apple. Currently, Amazon represents just 0.4% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio — although it’s still a $1.2 billion investment.

Berkshire Hathaway began buying Amazon in 2019, and Buffett has said he was “an idiot for not buying it [sooner].” Even though the stock still appears in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio — and Buffett is a fan — the CEO wasn’t the one who actually initiated the position.

As Buffett told CNBC at the time, “One of the fellows in the office that manage money … bought some Amazon,” referring to either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, his two main portfolio managers.

Although Amazon might not seem like a “classic” Buffett stock, it does have many of the competitive advantages that he has long espoused. From the economic “moat” around its business — which is hard for competitors to breach — to its customer satisfaction levels and excellent management, Amazon has many of the characteristics that make it a so-called “Buffett stock.” But Amazon’s also becoming a big player in the AI world.

The company recently made a big splash with its rollout of Bedrock, a direct competitor of ChatGPT that could revolutionize the industry. As told to TechCrunch, Vasi Philomin, VP of generative AI at Amazon Web Services, said Bedrock will apply “machine learning to the real world — solving real business problems at scale. … We think every application out there can be reimagined with generative AI.”

Snowflake (SNOW)

A somewhat lesser-known AI name favored by Buffett is Snowflake. Representing just 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, the Snowflake position is worth “only” about $907 million. But it does reflect Buffett’s evolving opinion of the types of stocks he should own, even though it’s likely one of his portfolio managers did the actual buying.

Snowflake’s platform, according to the company itself, “was designed from the ground up to support machine learning and AI-driven data science applications.” The cloud data warehouse company stores, processes and analyzes company information in conjunction with prominent cloud platforms Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.

While this could position the company for explosive future growth, it’s possible that Berkshire Hathaway bought into Snowflake because it was able to get shares in what was a very hot IPO in 2020.

Why a Meta-Magic Leap partnership makes sense – and may or (may not) be all about Apple,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T20:09:57Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-a-meta-magic-leap-partnership-makes-sense--and-may-or-may-not-be-all-about-apple-200957753.html,"Why a Meta-Magic Leap partnership makes sense – and may or (may not) be all about Apple

Meta (META) is reportedly in talks with augmented reality (AR) headset maker Magic Leap to license its tech. It's a deal that would make a lot of sense, as the possible drop of Apple's (AAPL) mixed reality headset draws nearer.

The ""why"" is really simple – mixed reality, by definition, requires both virtual reality (VR) and AR, and so far, Meta has focused on VR. AR provides a new avenue for Meta, which has had to battle VR skepticism, dwindling metaverse interest, and a cash-burning research and product operation that's far from profitable.

""Metaverse interest has cooled down in the past several months, but that doesn’t mean it is dead altogether,"" said IDC Research Director Ramon Llamas. ""Meta’s efforts with all things AI can be leveraged within AR and VR. Magic Leap can help extend that into the AR realm.""

A deal with Magic Leap would also lend Meta serious AR credibility, said Cathy Hackl, Journey Chief Futurist & Chief Metaverse Officer.

""If Meta licenses Magic Leap's visual tech, that would help Meta move faster with its AR glasses ambitions,"" said Hackl. ""The optics/waveguide tech work that [Magic Leap] has worked on is something very few companies have ever worked on to the degree that they have.""

Hackl, who worked at Magic Leap from 2018 to 2020, said the Florida-based company also has a lot of credibility when it comes to the metaverse – in fact, Magic Leap's ex-Chief Futurist Neal Stephenson, a famed science fiction writer, is credited with coining the term ""metaverse.""

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JANUARY 06: Attendee Jason Nguyen uses augmented reality (AR) glasses in a simulation at the Magic Leap booth during CES 2023 at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 6, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 08 and features about 3,200 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to more than 100,000 attendees. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)

""When I worked at Magic Leap, many of us thought Magic Leap would be the next Apple or the next tech juggernaut,"" said Hackl. ""That didn't turn out to be the case, but when I was there, the metaverse as a concept many of us were discussing with enterprise clients or a topic we would often mention on stage at conferences talking about the work we were doing toward building it, so I would say Magic Leap would have as strong a metaverse cred as any company that has been innovating and creating new products and processes in this specific space. What Magic Leap was able to accomplish as a startup was impressive despite the criticism it has gotten.""

Magic Leap, founded in 2010, has been subject of criticism for attracting billions in investments yet developing a still-imperfect mixed reality headset.

It's not just about Apple, experts say

It certainly seems more than coincidental that there are reports of Meta pursuing Magic Leap just a couple weeks before Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the event at which the company's expected to finally reveal its mixed reality headset. However, both Hackl and Llamas are skeptical that this is just about Meta keeping its lead over Apple.

""It allows Meta to enter the AR glasses space faster,"" said Hackl. ""Is a Magic Leap partnership enough to help Meta fend off Apple? I think you're asking the wrong question. I think what this partnership allows Meta is to become a more serious player in the AR glasses space and gives them an opportunity to tap into what [Magic Leap] has already created.""

Llamas agrees that this can't be all about the specter of Apple.

""As for fending off Apple, I wouldn’t say that it is the primary reason,"" said Llamas. ""If anything, both companies bring a set of skills and expertise to the table that the other may not necessarily have, and allows them to pursue a bigger total-available-market that neither could do independently.""

So, in the end, for Meta, as much as anything else, this is at least as much about growing that addressable market and the technology at their disposal, as it is about growing competition, he told Yahoo Finance.

""What I’d really like to see is Meta’s and Magic Leap’s respective experiences become available across both AR and VR,"" said Llamas. ""That’s not an easy thing to do, but assuming that Meta and Magic Leap can pull it off, that puts them in very strong position to meet more customers.""

Apple closes in on a $3 trillion stock market valuation,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-23T12:01:18Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-closes-in-on-a-3-trillion-stock-market-valuation-120118264.html,"A few more bites out of Apple's (AAPL) stock by investors, and we may find the tech giant's market cap beyond the $3 trillion level.

Shares of the iPhone maker have surged 35% year to date, out-performing the S&P 500 pedestrian's 9% gain. Apple is the fourth-best performing component of the closely tracked FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex, lagging the 105% gain in Meta (META), 41% increase in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and 39% appreciation in Amazon (AMZN).

In the process of its push higher, Apple has added about $690 billion in market cap. The company's stock market valuation now stands at $2.74 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance data, only 9% away from the $3 trillion mark.

Apple is the highest-valued company in the stock market, with Microsoft (MSFT) a close second, sporting a $2.38 trillion market cap.

Pros point to several reasons behind the impressive run in Apple's stock.

First, Apple continues to have a great story to tell investors on multiple fronts.

""For Apple there is massive installed base momentum going to the iPhone 15 anniversary cycle, and it has put a tailwind in the stock coupled by demand being solid in the field,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tells Yahoo Finance.

That two could become a three soon. (Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)

That installed base momentum could be stoked further at the company's 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off June 5.

Apple is widely anticipated to introduce the iOS 17 operating system. But some Apple watchers are holding out hope the company finally unveils its new AR/VR headset that has been in the works for years.

Meantime, Apple's latest quarterly results — while not perfect — have been viewed favorably by investors looking for relative safety amid the debt ceiling drama and sticky inflation.

""Overall, the results [from Apple] and guidance are exactly what investors were looking for from the company to feel reassured of its defensive positioning and at the same time the greater resilience of Big Tech in general in the current macro as well as on potential further macro deterioration, making it palpable to still keep paying 26x near-term earnings for Apple shares,"" said JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.

Chatterjee added: ""While we can see some investors squirm about a 26x earnings multiple, we believe the resilience of the business proving out in the numbers currently as well as the early part of the pandemic (2020) will amply justify the reasons to pay a premium.""

Another vote of confidence from a special investor has helped sentiment on Apple, too.

Billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said earlier this month he purchased more shares of Apple. Berkshire now owns a $151 billion stake in Apple, up from $1 billion in May 2016.

Berkshire is Apple's third-largest institutional shareholder, behind BlackRock (second) and Vanguard (one), according to Yahoo Finance data.

""Apple is different than the other businesses we own. It just happens to be a better business,"" Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting earlier in May.

As for what could trip up Apple's stock, pros find it hard to come up with a major selling event. Many highlight China's economic recovery stalling as a key risk to Apple's stock price in 2023, however.

Said Ives: ""Outside of the usual black swan events, the biggest risk to Apple’s stock is around the demand environment in China taking a step down. China is the hearts and lungs of the Apple growth story and so far so good, but that is the biggest risk for the stock.""

Walmart's Sam's Club has gone all in on AI. Will it help it get a leg up on Costco?,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-24T12:29:36Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmarts-sams-club-has-gone-all-in-on-ai-will-it-help-it-get-a-leg-up-on-costco-122936329.html,"Sam's Club aims to build an AI ecosystem to differentiate itself and give back time to its employees to help customers.

It's all AI, all the time, for Sam's Club.

Execs for the wholesale club unit of Walmart (WMT) told Yahoo Finance that it aims to build an extensive AI ecosystem to differentiate its store experience from its rivals.

One goal: more accurate inventory data. Another goal: give more time to employees to actually help customers as they shop. That's all crucial as the company competes for value conscious consumers with other membership-based retailers like BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and Costco (COST).

How? I recently had the chance, with Sam's Club executives, to get an inside look at how AI and technology is being used at a location in Secaucus, New Jersey. Here are some of the innovations:

Sign up: To get a membership, shoppers start by using an iPad (AAPL) and scan a QR code to add their membership card to the app. That routine once took roughly 20 minutes; it's now down to single digits, said Todd Garner, Sam's VP of retail product management.

Help! Displayed throughout the store, the QR Code, in the picture just below, allows customers to quickly ping an associate on an employee-facing app, called My Club, to come over and help. Garner said response time is ""getting pretty fast"" and customers can give immediate feedback on the exchange with the Sam's associate.

Ask Sam: If customers are curious where an item is, employees can ask an AI digital assistant, ""Ask Sam,"" on their iPhone or Google Android. It rolled out back in 2018 and now features new modifications like Spanish translations. Ashley Hughes, a market manager at Sam's Club in Secaucus told me: ""Ask Sam is pretty close to Siri and I think Siri pretty much knows how to do everything.""

Robo-shop: Chipotle's ""Chippy"" has nothing on Sam's store robot. Sam's fans can expect to see a robot roaming around called Scrubbers. Each club has one, for now, and are nicknamed. ""Roberta"" works the floor at the Secaucus club.

The robot was, in the past, just a robo-janitor. But now each has been retrofitted with an inventory intelligence tower. (""More bang for your buck,"" Garner added.)

Roberta's work day: it runs once a day between 8-10 AM to clean the floors and tell associates if the aisles are dirty. If an item is out of stock, or getting close to being out of stock, it notifies the app tool MyClub/Own Your Inventory (OYI). In a typical day, Roberta and its robot peers take 22 million pictures and automates 35% of inventory management tasks.

Known as Roberta at Sam's Club Secaucus, NJ location, scrubbers are now retrofitted with an AI-powered, intelligent towers (seen on left) to track inventory. (Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance)

Fresh sales tool: Another machine learning part of the app creates data forecasts around fresh food production. Pete Rowe, Sam's Club VP of technology, said all the data from the Scrubbers, plus employee insight, is used to predict, and understand inventory levels—particularly food than can quickly spoil.

The associate input is crucial, said Rowe. The machine does not know, at least not now anyway, that there's a local football tailgate that can up the demand for wings and beers. That said, forecasts for items like the ultra-popular rotisserie chicken can be updated hourly thanks to the new tech.

Buy more: ""Scan & Go,"" which has evolved to ""Scan & Go Fuel"" and ""Scan & Go Cafe,"" allows customers to pay for an entire order on the app, or schedule a mobile pickup at the cafe. The AI model also understands customer shopping preferences. That's why, before paying, you might get a ""Did You Forget?"" prompt to buy bacon along with the eggs you just picked up.

So far, Scan & Go seems like a hit for Sam's: its usage is up 230% since its inception in 2019.

The bottom line: it's an new world at Sam's, and other retailers, and there's no turning back.

Low-priced goods alone—and a lot of them— are no longer enough as Walmart CFO John David Rainey might tell you. ""It's not just around price."" he said on Yahoo Finance LIVE. ""It's also around convenience and that matters irrespective of what your income level is and so things like online pickup and delivery continue to grow in much faster rates than the rest of our business.""

Which is crucial for a company the size of Sam's.

This past quarter, for instance, Sam's produced sales of $20.5 billion, up 4.5%—along with a 6.3% increase in membership income. As of May 9, there are 600 Sam's Club locations in the U.S., per data platform ScrapeHero. That's compared to 589 Costco locations and 247 BJ's Wholesale Clubs.

Meanwhile, year-to-date, shares of Sam's parent company, Walmart, which will host its annual meeting next week, are up 4.2%. (Shares of BJ's are down some 3.8%; Costco, which is set to report Thursday after the bell, are up 6.0%.) The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP)? Down, 0.5%.

How's that Roberta?

""While there was some peaks and valleys in the interim years, we believe Nvidia is in a position to achieve that valuation over time."" That time could be as early as Thursday.

All eyes on are on Nvidia after it forecast $11 billion in sales for the second quarter of its fiscal 2024 late Wednesday, citing demand for its graphics processors that power artificial intelligence applications like the ones at Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. That forecast blew away Wall Street and turned the AI hype driving the stock into real results. ""Customers are 'racing' to meet large language models (LLMs) and generative AI based demand across all major modalities,"" Gill added. ""We see nearly all past headwinds behind us, and expect the company is shipping to true, AI-related demand, near-term."" The company's shares were already up 108% for the year ahead of Thursday's session. Nvidia's shocking sales guidance – more than 50% above the $7.15 billion analysts anticipated for the quarter – has catapulted its market cap forward almost overnight.

Shein is about to return to India in a big way,CNN,2023-05-26T09:51:55Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/business/shein-reliance-india-return-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong CNN —

Shein is plotting a major comeback in India, nearly three years after it was booted out of the country.

The fast fashion giant is partnering with the retail arm of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, a Shein spokesperson confirmed Friday. The tie-up with the richest man in the world’s most populous nation comes after Shein was banned by the Indian government in 2020 in a sweeping crackdown on Chinese companies.

Little details were made public on Friday. But in recent days, the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported that the two companies had struck a licensing deal that was subsequently approved by the government, allowing Shein to revive its presence in India.

According to the FT, which cited unidentified sources, the partnership will give Shein a share of profits from future sales through Reliance, while Ambani’s empire will help Shein ramp up its manufacturing in India for export markets.

“We can confirm Shein’s partnership with Reliance Retail and have no additional comment at this time,” a Shein spokesperson said. Reliance and India’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shein, an online retailer that competes with Zara and H&M (HNNMY), was banished from India in 2020 as the government banned dozens of Chinese apps in the wake of deadly border clashes that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.

At the time, Shein was headquartered in China. The company later moved to Singapore.

Shein crept back into the Indian market in 2021 through Amazon (AMZN), which included it as a seller for the Prime Day festival. The brand is still listed on the e-commerce giant’s Indian platform, where a small selection of apparel remains available.

A powerful partner

Its new partnership with Reliance Retail, which bills itself as the country’s largest retailer, could be a game-changer. Reliance has expanded aggressively in recent years, bringing in international brands such as 7-Eleven, Burberry, Muji and Pret-A-Manger.

One of the company’s malls also recently welcomed a prominent new anchor tenant: Apple (AAPL), which opened its first physical stores in India last month.

By teaming up with Shein, a seller of trendy goods that enjoys a cult following around the world, Reliance will be able to cater to younger consumers at lower price points.

That’s critical because many of the customers shopping online for the first time in India are young adults from “smaller cities,” according to Bain.

“They primarily purchase fashion as the first category online, and they typically start buying at entry price points,” the consultancy said in a report last year.

Shein, meanwhile, can use the partnership to tap into the world’s third largest e-commerce market, worth an estimated $50 billion in 2022. Fashion is a huge part of that, serving as one of the top drivers of growth, according to Bain.

Shein will also get to further diversify its sourcing, which has come under scrutiny from US lawmakers who have raised questions over whether the company is using forced labor in China.

This month, a bipartisan group of US legislators asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to require Shein to certify that none of its products made in China involve the use of Uyghur forced labor. Washington has banned all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang over such concerns.

Shein has said it doesn’t have any suppliers in the Xinjiang region, and it has zero tolerance for forced labor.

Apple (AAPL) is the largest company in the S&P 500.

It is also the largest large company the stock market has seen since at least 1980.

With a market cap north of $2.7 trillion, Apple currently comprises roughly 7.4% of the entire index's value, the highest share since 1980, according to data from Creative Planning's chief market strategist Charlie Bilello.

This is more than a full percentage point above the share of the index held by IBM (IBM) back in its ""Big Blue"" heyday in the mid-80s. A time when the company's dominance in the personal computer market was being challenged by a tiny upstart called Apple Computer.

Apple alone comprises more than 7% of the S&P 500, the most of any stock at any time since 1980. (Source: Charlie Bilello, via Twitter)

Concentration among the leaders of the S&P 500 has been a feature of the stock market for years.

And 2023 is no different.

Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up more than 9% with just 7 tech stocks driving all of the gains for the index, according to strategists at Bank of America Global Research — Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA).

Together, the S&P 500's five largest companies represent 22% of the index's value. And Apple alone is now worth more than the entire Russell 2000 (which has been hit hard by the crisis rocking regional banks).

For investors, Bank of America's takeaway is that buying the equal-weighted S&P 500 may be more attractive than the traditional market-cap weighted index.

Intuitively, a small handful of companies accounting for the bulk of the increase in what investors call the ""benchmark index"" sounds like the stock market itself is in a fragile state.

Go back a few years in this debate and we find strategists noting that the largest companies in the index also account for an outsized portion of profits earned by companies in the index. A trend which continues to hold up.

According to Bilello's data, Apple and Microsoft currently combine for just over 14% of the S&P 500's entire value.

And looking at data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, net income at Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft has totaled just over $222 billion over the last 12 months — or about 14% of aggregate profits earned by the entire S&P 500 over that period.

Wednesday Premarket Newsmakers: Why Oil Prices Are Rising Again,24/7 Wall St.,2023-05-24T11:48:46Z,https://247wallst.com/investing/2023/05/24/wednesday-premarket-newsmakers-why-oil-prices-are-rising-again/,"Wednesday Premarket Newsmakers: Why Oil Prices Are Rising Again

Premarket action on Wednesday had the three major U.S. indexes trading lower. The Dow Jones industrials were down 0.24%, the S&P 500 down 0.22% and the Nasdaq 0.13% lower.

Tuesday’s big story was the afternoon collapse of all three major indexes as it became clear that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden were getting nowhere in their negotiations to raise the federal debt limit. Stocks sank, bonds drifted downward and cryptocurrency took the biggest dip of all. Gold slipped by a fraction, and tech megacaps, the new safe haven, could not avoid the sell-off.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell by more than 1.6%, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) dropped more than 1.8% and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) closed down about 1.5%. Wednesday’s premarket session was on track to continue the decline. That leaves energy, and that is worth a look Wednesday morning as we wait for the weekly report on U.S. petroleum inventories.

Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) added nearly 3% on Tuesday after the stock was upgraded to Buy with a price target of $189 by HSBC. The Dow component is unlikely to see big share price gains, but its announced $7.6 billion acquisition of PDC Energy adds assets in both the Denver-Julesburg and Permian Basins to Chevron’s holdings and, more important, PDC’s solid free cash flow (about $1 billion annualized) should mean more returns for shareholders. Chevron is paying no cash in the all-stock deal and is acquiring proved reserves of oil and gas at a price of around $7 per barrel of oil equivalent.

The acquisition is not so much based on increasing production now as it is being among the last companies standing as the world makes the switch to electric vehicles (EVs). Internal combustion engines will remain a significant, but ever-declining, component of world transportation for decades. The Saudis and other Middle East oil producers will be there, and the world’s oil supermajors will be there too. Protests, like the one at Shell’s annual meeting earlier this week, are sure to increase, but the position of energy in the world economy will not change, and the role of oil in that position will change slowly.

After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude oil inventories declined by 6.7 million barrels last week. Analysts were expecting an addition of 525,000 barrels. Crude production remained flat at 12.2 million barrels a day, up by 300,000 year over year, but still 900,000 barrels below the all-time high set in March 2020. Gasoline inventories dropped by about 6.4 million barrels last week, and distillates (diesel fuel, heating oil) fell by 1.8 million barrels.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude added about 1.1% on Tuesday and traded up another 1.6% early Wednesday. Brent crude made similar moves higher. Brent’s per-barrel price is about $4 higher than WTI’s."

S&P 500 Back in the Range – For Now,ValueWalk,2023-05-25T14:56:57Z,https://www.valuewalk.com/sp-500-back-in-the-range-for-now/,"S&P 500 tumbled right through my 4,154 support, reaching all the way to another key milestone of 4,115. Heavy selling across the board, and my key metrics of XLF, XRT, XLI, XLB and IWM stumbled sufficiently just as tech did.

I‘m though looking for tech to not continue easily lower here, HYG and VIX indicate. The former by printing a lower knot before S&P 500 woke up, the latter by VIX being unable to hold 20.50.

Respite in selling is ahead, and ES taking on 4,165 is quite likely in order to close the preceding gap, even without being powered by debt ceiling resolution. The Fitch warning isn‘t enough at the moment, and a deal at the very last minute remains most likely, as the costs of not reaching it are prohibitively high.

So, today would be about unemployment claims allowing the Fed to remain hawkish – remember the big picture beyond tightening – and NVDA earnings aftermath – no matter how poor compared to a year ago, the markets chose to salivate over exuberant forward guidance while AI is going to make more money to others such as AAPL and MSFT, and would take longer to become reality.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq Outlook

If 4,154 resistance doesn‘t hold, 4,165 comes next, and that would hold without 4,177 jeopardized. It‘s too early though for the bears to reassume initiative even if my late in the day call to close ideally below 4,136, materialized. The bears need to regroup here, and get ready for tomorrow‘s core PCE surprise of inflation remaining quite sticky actually.

On one hand, 4,115 followed by 4,078 has to wait still – on the other hand, overcoming 4,225 seems unlikely at the moment, and would signify invalidation of the range breakout. Too early to call beyond today, but the steepness of this correction points to trouble overcoming 4,177 let alone 4,188.

S&P 500 Correction Starts,ValueWalk,2023-05-23T15:40:59Z,https://www.valuewalk.com/sp-500-correction-starts/,"S&P 500 rejected further upside, and is ready for correction within this upswing – the correction characteristics would determine the path forward as hearing Bullard talk two more rate hikes wasn‘t something the market had discounted.

2y yield rose to 5.40% , and 10y is above the midpoint of its recent range at 3.72% – yet stocks are holding up so far, and especially tech, Big Tech is ignoring the glaring disconnect to TLT – these two usually go hand in hand, but GOOGL, MSFT and AAPL with NVDA are still holding up.

Talking the last two, there is some short-term technical vulnerability (as in suspect series of latest daily candles) showing up, and I wonder how much more nosebleed for NVDA can come following its earnings tomorrow after the close.

Today is shaping up on a risk-off note, reflecting the poor European manufacturing data that has already pushed many real assets towards my corrective targets.

Meanwhile, the long-dated Treasuries outlook is going to change in the following weeks – the run higher will be though more muted than otherwise would have been thanks to the Fed no longer being the buyer, and Treasury General Account replenisment needs following debt ceiling resolution, which would work to suck some liquidity off the market place.

Recession is to start in Q3, and the consumer is getting increasingly into hot water. With household debt over $17T, credit card debt not really retreating (revolving credit up 17% in Mar annualized), the stress is showing in XRT and recent earnings calls from WMT, TGT… leaving AMZN not immune either, methinks.

Don‘t forget that the LEIs I mention so often, have been declining for 13 months in a row, and show no sign of turning. Fed isn‘t happy about the GDP, real estate or job market status as relates its larger inflation ight. Stock market sellers are to retake initiative once this rally runs its course.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq Outlook

4,154 is the first stop, and the fact we‘re reaching it with barely a move higher in USD but accompanied by significant real asset declines, means to me it would be worthwhile to not rush and instead assess the degree of buyers‘ weakness. 4,136 followed by 4,115 might not be that far, considering this is happening without any scary debt ceiling headlines.

Gold, Silver and Miners

Precious metals have still ways to go, and my gold $1,930 and other silver and copper targets loom. USD at 103.30 would prove cheap, and its upswing is ready to continue, with the debt ceiling resolution probably not signifying selloff, but relief over “default averted”.

S&P 500 Fine Selling Initiative,ValueWalk,2023-05-24T15:06:00Z,https://www.valuewalk.com/sp-500-fine-selling-initiative/,"S&P 500 buyers weren‘t really present yesterday, and the session finally finished on a strong, one-sided bearish note with all four conditions of mine (linked to) met. Dr copper was simply right in foretelling a down day yesterday. The many bearish medium-term signs described in latest extensive analyses, are raising their heads.

Aftermarket didn‘t bring any retracement attempt to speak of – instead, sellers retook initiative, and 4,154 turned into resistance. Also real assets confirm this is still a risk-off environment as illustrated by TLT jump higher.

Last but not least, UK inflation data isn‘t an isolated occurence of persistent core figures – US stocks still have to tackle the Fed tightening with lengthy pause vs. easing disconnect, onset of a genuine recession in Q3, LEIs declining for 13 months in a row, shrinking M2, deposits outflow hampering commercial lending, approaching real estate downward path continuation while unemployment claims pick up and Treasury starts issuing fresh debt to replenish TGA. Hardly a bullish cocktail.

Don‘t forget NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings and the highly likely disappointment not living up to the AI hype and chase.

Quoting from yesterday‘s long analysis:

(…) Big Tech is ignoring the glaring disconnect to TLT – these two usually go hand in hand, but GOOGL, MSFT and AAPL with NVDA are still holding up. Talking the last two, there is some short-term technical vulnerability (as in suspect series of latest daily candles) showing up, and I wonder how much more nosebleed for NVDA can come following its earnings tomorrow after the close.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq Outlook

4,154 is now resistance, ideally to hold on the closing basis. Dip buying is though to emerge first – bulls aren‘t going to give up without any intraday fight, even on no debt ceiling positive news. 4,136 breach followed by 4,115 are the key objectives, reaching which would take a while, and perhaps also Friday‘s core PCE coming in at least 0.3%. More banking sector, industrials, materials, retail and smallcaps weakness is essential.

Gold, Silver and Miners

Gold repelled the immediate danger of $1,930 and so did silver regarding $23.15. Next weeks would show whether these come into jeopardy again, or not – this week‘s lows are in.

Bitcoin tops blue-chip stocks in 10-year gains,Finbold.com,2023-05-26T11:43:46Z,https://finbold.com/bitcoin-tops-blue-chip-stocks-in-10-year-gains/,"To this day, the emergence and meteoric rise of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to captivate the world of investing and finance, standing as one of the most unprecedented events in recent history.

However, many are not entirely aware of how extraordinary Bitcoin’s price growth actually was, considering that the cryptocurrency was launched just 14 years ago. So let’s put it into numbers.

On Friday, May 26, prominent investor and market strategist Charlie Bilello posted a tweet, showing Bitcoin’s price gains over the last 10 years, compared to price increases recorded by some of the world’s biggest and most blue-chip stocks, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), among others.

The tweet shows that Bitcoin topped that list by some distance, raking in price gains of a whopping 19,968%, followed by Nvidia with 11,145%.

The gap gets even wider as the list progresses, with AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Apple stocks rising 2,896%, 2,884%, and 2,884% during that period, respectively. The likes of Microsoft, Facebook (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) saw their share price soar by 1,047%, 908%, and 459%, respectively.

BTC should be even higher right now, analysts say

Meanwhile, the price of gold – the safe-haven asset that’s considered a store of value and hedge against inflation, climbed just 34% in the past 10 years.

Earlier this week, JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note to clients that gold’s current price suggests that Bitcoin should be trading significantly higher, citing views by some investors that the two assets are interchangeable.

More specifically, BTC’s price should be somewhere around $45,000, which is roughly 70% higher than the cryptocurrency’s present price level of $26,452, the bank’s analysts said in a note published on May 24."
