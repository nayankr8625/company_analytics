MarketWatch: Nvidia barrels toward rare $1 trillion valuation after putting a dollar figure on AI boost,MarketWatch,2023-05-24T22:16:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-barrels-toward-rare-1-trillion-valuation-after-putting-a-dollar-figure-on-ai-boost-443b7d0f,"Nvidia Corp. headed toward market-capitalization gains of nearly $200 billion in after-hours trading Wednesday, which could put the chip maker within sight of becoming only the seventh U.S. company to top a valuation of $1 trillion.

Nvidia shares NVDA, +2.54% jumped 25% in the extended session Wednesday, after executives predicted that revenue would exceed the company’s record by more than 30% in the current quarter. The audacious forecast arrived as tech companies look to jump on advances in artificial intelligence that are largely powered by Nvidia’s computing gear.

Nvidia ended Wednesday’s session with a market cap — the total value of all shares in existence — of roughly $754.3 billion, according to FactSet. A 25% increase would add nearly $189 billion to that total, putting the company within striking distance of $1 trillion. Only six U.S. companies have ever attained a $1 trillion market cap: Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.41% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.14% are currently worth more than $2 trillion apiece; Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.92% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.44% have valuation of more than $1 trillion; and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, +3.70% and Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.72% have both touched the $1 trillion plateau previously.

Nvidia’s market cap was ahead of both Meta and Tesla as of Wednesday’s close, with both worth less than $650 billion, showing the potential fleeting nature of such a valuation. Nvidia’s record market cap is $834.4 billion, established on Nov. 29. 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

If Nvidia’s gains hold through Thursday’s trading session, the company could challenge for the largest one-day market-cap gain in history. The biggest currently on record was Amazon’s $191.2 billion increase on Feb. 4, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data, followed closely by a $190.9 billion gain by Apple on Nov. 10, 2022. Nvidia also stands to gain more than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +5.55% is worth in total — AMD ended Wednesday’s session with a market cap of $174.4 billion.

Nvidia is closing in on the rare $1 trillion plateau because of huge gains in its stock this year, as hopes and hype about generative AI have flooded the tech sector. After OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT AI offering, and investor Microsoft quickly integrated the chatbot into many of its services, expectations for the technology have exploded.

Despite the hype, most companies have avoided providing hard figures for revenue gains expected from AI. Nvidia’s fiscal second-quarter forecast — which calls for roughly $11 billion in sales, nearly 33% higher than Nvidia’s previous quarterly record of $8.28 billion — could be seen as the first sign of a wave of fresh spending coursing through the tech sector.

Other companies have indicated that they will be forced to spend to develop their technology before reaping large financial rewards from it. Microsoft, for example, disclosed to investors last month that capital expenditures are increasing as it builds AI capabilities into its Azure cloud-computing platform — spending that is largely going toward Nvidia.

That is a rather typical path for large jumps in tech spending: Companies that make the necessary hardware see gains before the companies that use that gear can develop offerings that take advantage of it. Other gear makers joined Nvidia in the sharp move higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, including AMD, which gained more than 10%; chip maker Marvell Technology Inc. MRVL, +32.42% , which increased more than 5%; and networking specialist Arista Networks Inc. ANET, +9.06% , which added about 5%."
"In One Chart: Stock market’s AI frenzy reinforces this crucial rule for traders, RenMac says",MarketWatch,2023-05-26T15:37:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-ai-frenzy-reinforces-this-crucial-rule-for-traders-renmac-says-fc248f84,"A mind-blowing Thursday surge by shares of chip maker Nvidia Corp. that fed a frenzy for artificial-intelligence stock market plays reinforces a cardinal rule for traders, said a technician at a top Wall Street research firm.

“Yesterday’s move in NVDA was one for the record books,” said Kevin Dempter, analyst at Renaissance Macro Research, in a Friday note. It also served as an example of the rule the firm preaches above all others, he said, which is to “‘not fear momentum.’”

Shares of Nvidia NVDA, +2.54% jumped 24% Thursday, putting a $1 trillion valuation in sight, after it delivered a blowout earnings forecast centered on soaring demand for chips related to artificial-inteligence applications. That built on an already staggering upside run for the stock, which is up nearly 160% so far in 2023.

Read: Nvidia stock is the most overbought in 18 months, but that doesn’t mean the rally is over

“Just because a strong stock or sector is overbought after a big run doesn’t mean you should sell it. Strength begets strength and the rich get richer, embrace momentum,” Dempter wrote. (See chart below.)

Renaissance Macro Research

Nvidia shares added another 2.5% on Friday, while the megacap-tech-concentrated Nasdaq-100 NDX, +2.58% logged a 3.4% weekly gain, up more than 30% for the year to date. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% rose 1.3% Friday, turning positive on the week and up around 9.5% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.00% bounced Friday, snapping a five-day losing streak but logging a 1% weekly fall.

See: ‘Unprecedented’ and ‘unfathomable.’ Nvidia makes jaws drop on Wall Street as stock explodes higher.

So should investors chase the rally? Not so fast there, either.

Dempter said RenMac still wouldn’t fade the move, but it might pay now to be patient and let overbought conditions get worked off before looking to add positions.

He noted that the rally comes amid a list of understandable reasons for caution. The breadth — the number of stocks advancing versus declining — continues to weaken, with just 37% of the issues in the broad S&P 1500 index above their 200-day moving average and new 20-day lows outnumbering 20-day highs. The equal-weight measure of the S&P 500 recently witnessed a “dark” or “death” cross in which the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.

And the AI rally has some market watchers pondering if another bubble may be in the works.

Fidelity’s MSCI Information Technology ETF FTEC, +2.68% , which allocates 23% to Apple, AAPL, +1.41% 19% to Microsoft MSFT, +2.14% and 6% to Nvidia was up by more than 3.5% Thursday, and 40% since last October 2022 dip. It currently trades 30 times the earnings, while the S&P500’s price-to-earnings ratio is only around 22, noted Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, in a note. She observed that Nvidia’s P/E ratio spiked to 219 Thursday.

It all points to a “bubble in the making” for AI-related stocks, she said, warning that it “could soon be time for a correction.”

Dempter said that despite broader market concerns, “we still want to embrace those areas that are breaking out [with] momentum. It may be narrow, but we would remain overweight tech and would stick with the leaders while embracing improving trends in the sector,” he said.

It’s hard to say how the AI boom will play out, but Dempter argued it’s smart to stay long the names that have already benefited most.

AMZN vs. AAPL: Which Big Tech Stock is Better? - TipRanks,Google News,2023-05-25T21:48:29Z,https://consent.google.com/ml?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvYW16bi12cy1hYXBsLXdoaWNoLWJpZy10ZWNoLXN0b2NrLWlzLWJldHRlctIBAA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&hl=en-US&cm=2&pc=n&src=1,"In this piece, I evaluated two big tech stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Of course, Amazon and Apple need no introduction. Amazon has exploded 34% year-to-date, bringing its one-year return to 3.5%. Meanwhile, Apple is up 38.7% year-to-date and 21% over the last year. Notably, Apple is trading close to its record high, while Amazon is significantly off its all-time high.

Technology stocks have been broadly outperforming those in other sectors. Although tech names make up several of the highest-weighted names in the S&P 500 (SPX), it has gained about 8% year-to-date versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s (NDX) 26% year-to-date gain. Thus, investors might be wondering whether there’s any near-term upside left, so a closer look is in order.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Amazon has faced some issues recently that may be restraining its stock. However, given its long-term stability, a bullish view looks appropriate, as the current restraints on its stock price appear to have created a nice entry point for investors.

It’s long been a challenge to estimate Amazon’s valuation because it has so many moving parts. In addition to the e-commerce business the company is so well-known for, it also has recurring revenue in the form of Prime subscriptions.

Additionally, the Amazon Web Services platform serves numerous companies. Amazon also has its own devices and other branded products for sale on its platform and is developing various technologies, including Alexa, its digital assistant backed by artificial intelligence.

Notably, hedge funds unloaded 10 million shares of Amazon in the last quarter, which is one driver of the sell-off. Still, the company’s Retail segment generated $343 million in operating losses for the first quarter, a massive improvement from the $2.85 billion it lost in the year-ago quarter. Amazon Web Services continues to generate Amazon’s profits, although its operating expenses have risen, just as they have at other tech companies.

Amazon’s net income margin fell into the red for 2022, at -0.5%, but it began to recover in the first quarter, coming in at 0.8% for the last 12 months. As things stand now, it looks like Amazon is starting to recover, which is why its stock is up so much year-to-date. However, it looks like there will be more room to run in the near term.

Even if Amazon shares stagnate temporarily, I believe that buying and holding them for the long term will likely generate solid returns because this company isn’t going anywhere.

What is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?

Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 35 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $134.85, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 17.3%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

On the one hand, Apple is one stock many investors buy and hold for the long term. However, on the other, the iPhone maker is trading close to its record high, making Amazon look like the better value option. Since a better entry point appears likely in the near future, a neutral view seems appropriate for Apple, but only in the short term.

Like Amazon, Apple is a stable, steadily-growing technology company. Of course, it’s far more profitable, as it isn’t saddled with an e-commerce business that often loses money and retains ultra-low profits when it’s in the green. However, Apple is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29.2 versus its five-year average P/E of 25.4, making it look slightly overvalued.

While hedge funds widely sold Amazon, they gobbled up over 16 million shares of Apple in the last quarter. Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) also bought more Apple shares in the last quarter.

What is the Price Target for AAPL Stock?

Apple has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $181.88, the average Apple stock price target implies upside potential of 5.1%.

Conclusion: Bullish on AMZN, Short-Term Neutral on AAPL

At this stage, it’s hard to go wrong with either Amazon or Apple. Many investors consider Amazon and Apple as both stocks they would buy and hold for the long term. Neither company looks like they’re in danger, as they are both stable and growing, but Amazon looks slightly better than Apple in terms of its valuation.

Of course, though, a recession or general downtick in investor sentiment for tech stocks could create better entry points for both.

Warren Buffett Just Bought More Apple Shares. Should You?,Motley Fool,2023-05-25T11:30:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/warren-buffett-just-bought-more-apple-shares-shoul/,"If you look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, you can see a clear preference for one company: Apple (AAPL 1.41%). Berkshire's stake in the company is worth over $156 billion -- an incredible 47% of its investment portfolio. With Berkshire's $700 billion market cap, it's not unfair to say that over a fifth of the company is Apple.

While most investors would be uncomfortable with that concentration level, Berkshire clearly isn't. It added 20 million more shares (about a 2% increase in its stake) during the first quarter. So should you follow Buffett's example with Apple, or are there better investments out there? Let's take a look.

Is Buffett forsaking his value-investing roots?

Apple's products have become a staple for the American consumer. Whether it's a MacBook, AirPods, or the ever-popular iPhone lineup, Apple has successfully launched and developed a product ecosystem few companies could ever dream of achieving.

It has also been responsible with its finances, garnering praise from Buffett and his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, for many years.

These two, along with many in the financial media, have cheered investors on to own more Apple stock, since it has been one of the best-executing businesses since Buffett established his position in 2016.

To be clear, this investment has worked out well over the past decade, with a total return of 629% versus the S&P 500's 135%. But the price of Apple's stock makes me scratch my head at Buffett's latest move, since he is a famous value investor.

When Berkshire first bought Apple in 2016, the stock had a dirt cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12. Now, it's valued at around 30 times earnings.

This valuation increase isn't entirely due to widespread coverage of Apple stock ownership; a lot of it has to deal with the company's improving profitability. Even though it has only moved up 3 percentage points, when the company generates nearly $400 billion in revenue, that works out to $12 billion more in profits -- a massive increase.

Still, is that enough to warrant a valuation near 30 times earnings? I don't think so.

Apple isn't putting up the growth needed for its valuation

An earnings multiple of 30 is usually reserved for a rapidly growing company -- something Apple isn't. In fact, its revenue fell nearly 3% in the second quarter (ending April 1). While profit margins stayed relatively stable, its earnings per share fell $0.01 because of the revenue drop.

That revenue drop can be attributed to a weaker consumer, but it also reflects how difficult it is to grow when you have become that large. Even in 2024, when many companies expect the economy to return to strength, Wall Street analysts only project 6.4% revenue growth.

Apple will likely need to grow faster to maintain a premium valuation like that.

So, do I think the stock will come crashing down? Absolutely not. Because of its widespread ownership individually and through index funds (Apple makes up 7.4% of the S&P 500 and 12.5% of the Nasdaq 100), the shares have become insulated from rapid drops, because it would require a lot of investors to sell at once.

But I don't think Apple can deliver the growth it needs. A significant portion of the stock's performance over these past few years has come from multiple expansions, or when investors are willing to pay a more significant premium for the stock.

With that catalyst gone, it has to deliver based on business performance. While it can still succeed at the business level, it won't be as fast as some other companies are growing, which is why I think investors looking for greater upside should look elsewhere.

Still, if you want a steady company as a parking spot for your savings before retirement or to stabilize your portfolio (similar to how Berkshire is doing it), you could do much worse than Apple.

Apple stock has its place in life, but if you're looking for the best possible returns, it doesn't fit the bill from a forward-looking standpoint."
2 Winning Stocks to Buy No Matter What the Market Is Doing,Motley Fool,2023-05-28T09:05:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/28/2-winning-stocks-buy-no-matter-market/,"Stocks can swing wildly from year to year, as investors were reminded in 2022. While investors can't control the markets, some stocks allow them to sleep well at night better than others.

Microsoft (MSFT 2.14%) and Apple (AAPL 1.41%) provide essential services people use every day, and new technologies and product development are only strengthening their long-term growth prospects. Here's why these two top stocks will continue winning for investors over the long term.

1. Microsoft

You would be hard-pressed to find a more solid investment than Microsoft. Windows and Office software are widely used in the consumer and enterprise spaces, and Microsoft has successfully migrated these products to subscription services in recent years, leading to robust growth in earnings that helped fuel the stock's performance.

Microsoft is posting balanced revenue and earnings growth despite a challenging business environment. In the most recent quarter, Office and cloud services growth drove double-digit year-over-year increases in revenue and earnings per share on a constant-currency basis.

Thanks to the company's investment in OpenAI -- the creators behind popular artificial intelligence (AI)-powered text app ChatGPT -- Microsoft is also bringing smart AI tools to its Office suite, which could drive more demand.

Another reason to consider Microsoft a solid investment for the long haul is its booming enterprise cloud services business. Microsoft Azure has soared to second place behind Amazon over the last five years. Microsoft mentioned on the last earnings call that it now has more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI customers using the service's advanced language models, up an impressive 10-fold over the previous quarter.

These developments make clear that advancing technology only strengthens Microsoft's competitive moat. Microsoft has the cash flows to invest in the latest technologies fueling demand for its core software services, and that's the main reason investors can rely on the stock to keep reaching new highs over time, no matter what happens in the near term.

2. Apple

The iPhone maker is another solid stock that should continue to grow in value for years to come, regardless of what happens in the markets in the near term. The stock fell in 2022, along with everything else, but has rebounded around 32% this year. Apple generates enormous amounts of cash from operations, pays a regular dividend, and has an enviable brand.

As noted by last year's dip in the stock price, Apple is not immune from market swings, but investors can count on consistent revenue every year from a loyal customer base that continues to buy more devices. This leads to consistent, robust free cash flow the company can return to shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases.

Apple said its installed base of devices hit another record in the most recent quarter. It entered the year with more than 2 billion devices across its customer base, up from 1.3 billion at the start of 2018. It's unsurprising that as more customers have purchased an Apple product and spent money on subscriptions and apps, Apple's free cash flow has also grown to $97 billion, or 78% higher than five years ago.

With over 2 billion active devices, you might be wondering how much more Apple can grow. It can keep growing that figure through new product releases and converting customers from competing smartphone manufacturers.

Apple is expected to finally unveil its long-rumored mixed-reality headset next month at the company's annual Worldwide Developers' Conference. While initial sales are expected to be modest at best, especially at the rumored $3,000 price point, the product could grow in importance over the long term like the Apple Watch did after its 2015 launch.

Investors should also expect Apple to find ways to wow customers with new AI features in its existing product lineup, which could convert non-Apple users to try an iPhone. After all, CEO Tim Cook credited the recent increase in the installed base to ""a large number of switchers"" following the iPhone 14 launch last fall.

Apple's underlying edge over competitors is brand power. And that's why Warren Buffett has sunk billions into the stock in recent years and why investors can expect Apple to keep winning for shareholders for years to come."
Want Passive Income Forever? Buy These 2 Magnificent Stocks Now,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T13:53:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/want-passive-income-forever-buy-these-magnificent/,"Many investors actively seek dividend stocks, and who can blame them? Nothing beats making money while you sleep. But when investing in dividend-paying companies, there is always the risk that these corporations will reduce or suspend their payouts altogether. Choosing the right dividend stocks is arguably the best way to avoid this risk: Not all dividend stocks are created equal.

With that said, let's turn our attention to two companies that are practically passive income machines and will likely continue rewarding shareholders with payout increases for a long time: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.04%) and Apple (AAPL 1.41%).

1. Johnson & Johnson

Johnson & Johnson has a history that dates back more than 100 years. Most businesses struggle to survive a decade, so this feat is highly impressive. It's because J&J offers goods that are always in high demand. It is a leading pharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of medicines spanning several therapeutic areas, from infectious diseases to oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and more.

Moreover, Johnson & Johnson spends ample money on research and development and routinely adds new products to its vast portfolio. Drugmakers can cease being relevant if they stop innovating. That is unlikely to happen to this pharma giant. The company's medical devices unit also offers a range of products that physicians use to improve health outcomes for their patients.

Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson records consistent revenue, profits, and free cash flow.

Financial health is essential as no company can sustain dividend increases over the long run without that. And as an added piece of evidence of Johnson & Johnson's financial health, the company boasts an AAA rating from Standard & Poor, a testament to its strong balance sheet. Even if the U.S. Federal Reserve's predicted recession hits us before the end of the year, the healthcare giant should be just fine.

Johnson & Johnson has had to navigate various lawsuits against it in recent years regarding opioids as well as its talc-based baby powder, but these processes will play themselves out eventually. The company has survived plenty of downturns and challenges in its long history.

Finally, Johnson & Johnson has been excellent at hiking its payouts. The drugmaker is a Dividend King. It is currently on its 60th consecutive year of dividend increases. Very few corporations have a better track record. Johnson & Johnson's current 3.03% dividend yield is above that of the S&P 500 at 1.66%.

Although its cash payout ratio of 73% seems high, the company has the tools necessary to continue doing what it has been doing for a long time: slowly and steadily growing its dividend. Investors can sleep easy knowing that Johnson & Johnson's payouts are secure.

2. Apple

Apple isn't in the business of selling medicines. Most of the things it offers are, strictly speaking, goods that can eventually become obsolete. But the company is still an excellent stock to buy and hold forever. Here is why: Apple has built an incredibly strong brand name and a culture of technological innovation.

The company is an expert at transforming existing tech into better and more sophisticated versions of essentially the same thing. Cell phones existed before the iPhone, and AirPods are just fancy earbuds, among other examples. Once branded with its logo, these devices typically command high prices, even though plenty of cheaper substitutes are available. That speaks to Apple's customer loyalty, a powerful competitive edge.

That's why the company reports solid financial results even in challenging economic times.

AAPL Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.

However, Apple has been seeking to diversify its revenue base. It increasingly relies on its services segment, which offers everything from Apple Cloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and much more. This business still makes up a small percentage of its top line, but it has grown in importance. Apple's installed base now stands at more than two billion devices worldwide.

The company should benefit from this for years to come as it finds new ways to monetize its large base of customers. Apple is making headway in fintech and has also been looking to enter the healthcare industry in some way. Turning to the company's dividends, its 0.55% yield is low, but it has raised its payouts by 120% in the past decade. With a very modest cash-payout ratio of 15.3%, there are miles of room left for more hikes.

While not primarily known for its dividends, Apple can give passive income seekers exactly what they want while delivering market-beating returns."
Here's How Apple Is Making iPhone More Useful Via iOS 17 When Lying Idle And A Lot More,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-25T14:31:43Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-apple-making-iphone-more-143143665.html,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) eyed a new interface for iPhones to make them more useful while lying idle via its iOS 17 software update, Dawn, which will reach consumers in 2023.

The new interface will show information, including calendar appointments, the weather, and notifications in the style of a smart-home display, Bloomberg cites knowledgeable sources.

The view will appear when an iPhone is locked and positioned horizontally, similar to that of Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).

Apple plans to showcase the software launch alongside its mixed-reality headset at the Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5.

The move marks its broader push to embed live information in more parts of the company’s software, including the Apple Watch’s interface.

The Apple feature will use a dark background with bright text. It proposes to build on the company’s launch of lock screen widgets in 2022 as part of iOS 16.

The iPhone maker is also working on a new horizontal interface for the iPad.

Apple is exploring other ways to turn its devices into smart-home displays, like developing a low-cost tablet that can magnetically attach to walls and stands.

As part of iOS 17, Apple is also planning significant changes to the iPhone’s Wallet app and location services. Apple eyes a new journaling app to add note-taking.

The company proposes incorporating health changes with new features for logging mood and coping with weak vision. Apple is planning to bring the Health app to the iPad.

Apple is also working on upgrades for SharePlay, its feature that lets users FaceTime while collaborating in apps, and AirPlay, which beams content from Apple devices to TVs and speakers."
"1 Green Flag for Broadcom in 2023, and 1 Red Flag",Motley Fool,2023-05-25T13:26:01Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/1-green-flag-for-broadcom-in-2023-and-1-red-flag/,"Broadcom's (AVGO 11.52%) stock is up about 30% over the past 12 months, bucking the broader slowdown in the semiconductor market. It outperformed most of its peers because its deep diversification across the data center, networking, wireless, storage, and industrial chip markets insulated it from the post-pandemic slowdown of the PC and smartphone markets. It also diversified its business away from semiconductors with the expansion of its infrastructure software business.

Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last October), Broadcom's revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%, while its adjusted EPS rose at a CAGR of 19%. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 7% and 10%, respectively, this year, even as the macroeconomic headwinds rattle the broader markets.

Its stock looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings, and it pays a respectable forward yield of 2.7%. All those facts and figures suggest Broadcom is still worth buying at these levels. But investors should take note of two recent events -- which can be considered as a green flag and a red flag for its future -- before pressing the ""sell"" button.

The green flag: A new multibillion-dollar deal with Apple

Broadcom produces Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, wireless charging, and other radio frequency chips for Apple's (AAPL 1.41%) iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Back in 2020, Apple and Broadcom galvanized that long-term relationship with exclusive contracts that would pay the chipmaker approximately $15 billion in revenue through 2023.

However, several reports from earlier this year suggested Apple could replace Broadcom's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chips with its own first-party chips by 2025. Those rumors cast dark clouds over Broadcom's future since the company relied on Apple for 20% of revenue in fiscal 2022.

But some of those clouds recently parted when Apple announced that it had inked a new multibillion-dollar agreement to purchase Broadcom's 5G radio frequency components and other wireless connectivity parts from Broadcom over the next few years.

Apple didn't specify the exact value or length of the deal (or if it includes its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chips), but it allays some bearish concerns that Apple could unexpectedly replace all of Broadcom's chips with its own first-party silicon.

The red flag: The VMware deal is still stuck in the mud

To diversify its business away from Apple and the cyclical semiconductor market, Broadcom expanded its infrastructure software division with its acquisitions of CA in 2018 and Symantec's enterprise security unit in 2019. In 2022, it agreed to buy the cloud software giant VMware (VMW 4.21%) for $61 billion.

That takeover would enable Broadcom to generate about half of its revenue from infrastructure software, compared to just 29% of its revenue in fiscal 2022. But that deal still faces intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe.

In March, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the deal that will last through September. In April, the European Commission (EC) sent Broadcom a ""statement of objections"" to the deal, saying that it could restrict competition in certain product categories. The EC also recently extended its deadline for making a final call on that deal from June 21 to July 17.

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has reportedly been trying to garner enough third-party support to launch a full-blown antitrust lawsuit against Broadcom. In other words, Broadcom's planned takeover of VMware could remain in limbo for a very long time.

Which of these flags should be flown higher?

Broadcom's VMware deal faces a lot of regulatory hurdles, but that isn't all that surprising given the size of the deal. Meanwhile, Apple's big deal with Broadcom is more interesting and newsworthy -- especially since investors had been bracing for a sudden divorce between the two companies. Therefore, I believe that the green flag should fly a lot higher than the red flag."
Is Microsoft Stock a Buy?,Motley Fool,2023-05-25T12:37:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/is-microsoft-stock-a-buy/,"Tech investors have had a good year so far, but the 22% surge in the Nasdaq Composite index still pales in comparison to the returns that Microsoft (MSFT 2.14%) owners have seen. The software giant is up over 30% through mid-May, in fact.

Wall Street is excited about the prospects for its cloud services division and the potential for a generally strong selling environment ahead for enterprise software. Looking further out, Microsoft might see excellent returns from attractive niches like video games, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI).

But does the over $2 trillion valuation on the business mean that expectations are too high for investors to see decent returns from here? Let's take a closer look.

More diverse than Apple

Microsoft and Apple (AAPL 1.41%) both have valuations over $2 trillion, yet Microsoft delivers more diversification than the iPhone maker does. Owning this stock means an investor is exposed to several growing tech segments like cybersecurity, subscription gaming services, and cloud enterprise software. That range of growth prospects is possible to achieve without owning Microsoft stock, but would require an investor to buy several other niche players.

The company's latest results show the strength of having this deep portfolio. While parts of the business, like games and PC hardware, shrank in early 2023, Microsoft's global revenue still rose 10%. Apple's sales ticked lower by about 3%, by comparison.

Profits and cash flow

The financial risk for Microsoft investors is also relatively low. The tech stock maintains some of the highest profitability on the market, with operating profit margin now sitting above 40% of sales. Microsoft generated $59 billion of operating cash flow over the past nine months, down only slightly from the prior-year period.

Its ample cash generation has allowed executives to build up a large savings even as they invest in growth initiatives like AI and the Activision Blizzard acquisition. There's always the risk that big moves like this will destroy shareholder value. But Microsoft's track record has been generally positive on this score.

Paying up

That means the biggest risk for prospective investors is paying too high of a price for this profitable business. That's not a hard case to make given that Microsoft shares are valued at over 11 times annual sales compared to the pandemic high of about 13. Apple can be bought for 7 times revenue, by comparison. There are some rational reasons to believe that this premium valuation can drop over the next few years, including a downturn in IT spending or disappointing returns from AI investments and the Activision purchase.

On the other hand, Microsoft can also grow into that valuation by continuing to expand sales at a double-digit rate while maintaining its market-thumping profitability. And, either way, shareholders are likely to see strong returns, including direct cash returns from stock buyback spending and dividends. While Microsoft isn't going to double its market capitalization anytime soon, investors can still generate market-beating returns by holding the stock as part of a diverse growth-focused portfolio."
"Amid the Deal with Apple, Is It Too Late to Buy Broadcom Stock?",Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:25:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/amid-deal-apple-too-late-buy-broadcom-stock/,"In a move that surprised some investors and analysts, Apple (AAPL 1.41%) signed a new multi-billion deal with Broadcom (AVGO 11.52%), which will drive the development of components related to 5G radio frequencies. The announcement sent Broadcom stock higher as the relationship between the two companies expanded.

Of course, this semiconductor stock was already on the rise before the announcement, so the added news now has the stock trading at record highs. Given its already elevated stock price, does this latest deal make Broadcom a buy, or did investors miss their opportunity?

The Apple-Broadcom deal

Broadcom's chip segment develops semiconductors for other companies. It invests billions per year in research and development, and it employs engineers near its large clients to develop solutions collaboratively. One fan of its approach is Apple, which was an important Broadcom client before this deal. Broadcom designs the chips that power the Wi-Fi hotspot for the iPhone and other products, and this relationship accounted for about 20% of Broadcom's revenue in 2022.

Much remains unknown about the new deal. Neither company disclosed financial terms, although Apple said the agreement was part of a commitment made in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy.

Moreover, Apple has recently brought more chip development in-house and wanted to develop its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, according to a Bloomberg report. Until recently, this led to fears that Apple would scale back its relationship with Broadcom. Hence investors probably looked at this perceived turnabout as a surprise.

The state of Broadcom's stock

As mentioned before, investors expressed their surprise at the deal by bidding Broadcom stock up to record highs. Consequently, Broadcom's stock price is up more than 25% over the last 12 months.

And even after declining for most of 2022, revenue and profits continue to surge. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 29), revenue of $8.9 billion rose 12% year over year, primarily driven by a 17% increase in product sales.

During that time, it limited increases in the cost of revenue and reduced operating expenses. That helped it report a quarterly net income of $3.8 billion, rising 57% compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2022.

Surprisingly, its rising stock price has not made Broadcom an expensive stock, as it sells at a P/E ratio of 23. That multiple is above multi-year lows, but it still trades at a lower valuation than Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices. Additionally, Broadcom remains one of the more lucrative dividend stocks in the semiconductor industry. At $18.40 per share annually, it claims a dividend yield of about 2.5%, well above the 1.6% average of the S&P 500.

Also, that payout has risen annually since 2011, with the dividend increasing by 12% after the most recent increase. This cash return provided stability amid the stock's considerable growth. And because the company's $3.9 billion quarterly free cash flow far exceeded the $1.9 billion dividend cost for the period, its payout should stay safe.

Should I consider Broadcom?

Despite a multi-billion deal with Apple, it is not too late to buy Broadcom stock. Admittedly, most investors would probably like more details on the terms of this specific deal.

However, Broadcom posted solid growth in fiscal Q1 before the deal. Due to its P/E ratio of 23 and a high dividend, the stock appears undervalued. And with the company strengthening its relationship with Apple, Broadcom stock will likely continue to move higher over time."
3 Top AI Stocks That Pay Dividends -- and 1 Yields Over 5%,Motley Fool,2023-05-25T09:52:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/25/3-top-ai-stocks-that-pay-dividends-1-yields-over-5/,"Income investors can find their portfolios loaded with boring companies. That's not a bad thing, though. Boring companies often provide the most reliable dividends.

However, it's possible to receive income and invest in one of the most exciting opportunities on the planet -- artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three top AI stocks that pay dividends.

1. IBM

IBM (IBM 1.68%) has been a favorite for income investors for years, and it still is. The tech giant offers a dividend yield of nearly 5.2%. IBM has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1916 and increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years.

Sure, IBM hasn't been at the center of attention with the recent surge in interest in AI. However, the company has been an AI pioneer for a long time. For example, its Watson technology made headlines in 2011 by beating Jeopardy! champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.

But is IBM still a contender in AI? Yep. IBM remains an industry leader in the number of AI patents held. Gartner's Magic Quadrant ranks the company as a leader in conversational AI. IBM Watson is now being used across of wide range of industries.

2. Microsoft

Unlike IBM, Microsoft (MSFT 2.14%) has been at the forefront of the AI world this year. The company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Microsoft has also integrated OpenAI's generative AI technology into its products, including its Bing search engine.

These AI efforts have caught investors' attention. Microsoft stock is up more than 30% year to date, largely as a result of its AI-related moves. CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed in Microsoft's recent quarterly conference call that the company is ""going to lead in the AI era.""

While Microsoft is well-known these days for its AI leadership, it's easy to forget that the company offers a dividend, but its yield of under 0.9% isn't anything to get excited about. However, Microsoft has increased its dividend for 13 consecutive years. It's also in a strong financial position to keep that streak going.

3. Apple

Apple (AAPL 1.41%) reigns as the largest company in the world, based on market cap. But the huge technology company doesn't get much attention these days for its AI expertise or its dividend.

The company's Siri virtual assistant is still one of the most widely used AI tools, although it seems dated after the introduction of ChatGPT. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently stated that the company ""view[s] AI as huge.""

He added that Apple plans to ""continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis."" Recent staff recruiting by the company indicates that it's accelerating its efforts in multiple areas of AI development.

Apple's dividend is the lowest of these three AI stocks, with a yield of under 0.6%. But the company has increased its dividend every year since initiating the program in 2012. Apple also has plenty of financial flexibility to continue boosting its dividend payout in the future.

Are they buys?

My view is that all three of these AI dividend stocks are solid picks, depending on your investing style. Income investors will probably like IBM the most since it pays the most attractive dividend. Growth investors will be more interested in Apple and Microsoft, both of which should be able to capitalize on the AI boom in the coming years."
L'indicateur de géolocalisation de macOS 13.4 imite parfaitement celui d'iOS,MacGeneration,2023-05-26T13:15:33Z,https://www.macg.co/macos/2023/05/lindicateur-de-geolocalisation-de-macos-134-imite-parfaitement-celui-dios-137095,"À peine intégré dans macOS, l'indicateur de géolocalisation a été discrètement modifié. Dans macOS 13.3, ce nouvel indicateur, qui apparait lorsqu'une application utilise votre géolocalisation, prenait juste la forme d'un petit point bleu dans la barre des menus, à droite du bouton qui sert à ouvrir le centre de contrôle.

L'indicateur de géolocalisation dans macOS 13.3 à gauche et dans macOS 13.4 à droite

Comme l'a remarqué le site AAPL Ch., dans macOS 13.4, Apple a ajouté un détail : à l'intérieur du point bleu figure une petite flèche blanche. La signification de l'indicateur est ainsi beaucoup plus claire. Au bout de trois secondes, le rond bleu disparait, mais la flèche reste présente quelques secondes de plus. En fait, cet indicateur est maintenant parfaitement identique à celui d'iOS.

macOS 13.4

Comme pour l'indicateur orange d'utilisation du micro apparu dans Monterey, Apple ne donne pas la possibilité de désactiver l'affichage du petit point bleu — ce qui est assez logique puisqu'il s'agit d'une mesure de confidentialité visant à vous prévenir d'éventuelles utilisations abusives de votre Mac. Si le point orange vous embête pour une raison légitime, un utilitaire, Recording Indicator Utility, permet de le cacher, mais il demande de désactiver SIP pour bidouiller des fichiers du système."
: Did Nvidia just help create an AI-fueled stock bubble?,MarketWatch,2023-05-26T20:25:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/did-nvidia-just-help-create-an-ai-fueled-stock-bubble-ef607f51,"Tech stocks have roared back, but the current mania for artificial intelligence appears to expect too much too soon, which creates the possibility of a bubble.

Amid a first quarter of mostly mediocre growth and little in the way of guidance for the second half of the year, there was a lot of hype and hope about the future impact of AI. Big Tech stocks added more than $2 trillion in market capitalization in the first quarter, much of that based on hopes for the future and on some of these stocks now being viewed as havens in an economic storm.

Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +2.54% seemed to justify the investment this week, stunning Wall Street with a whopping projection for its next quarterly revenue target, fueled in part by sales of Nvidia chips to power AI-driven data centers. Those gains rippled throughout the tech sector, as investors were excited to see any company put some actual numbers on this frightening and awesome technology.

The theory would be that after that money surges into Nvidia, it will soon move to the companies buying the tech from Nvidia in order to live up to their AI hype. But that may not happen for years. Much of the tech sector will be in investing and spending mode for a while — which is great for Nvidia, but not a guarantee that other tech companies will soon see the same returns.

“It is somewhat unique to Nvidia,” said Daniel Newman, principal analyst and founding partner at Futurum Research. “Not only it is an arms race, it is a supply race. It’s pretty safe to say that the hyperscalers are leading this, then the biggest enterprises are next. They are trying to get their hands on every system they can get. They don’t know entirely why yet, they just know they need all the computing power they can get, every scrap of inventory they can get their hands on.”

More from Therese: Nvidia CFO on record-breaking forecast: ‘The inflection point of AI is here’

Newman likened the current spending spree on AI systems to building a structure when steel is in short supply. “So they are buying all the steel they can get their hands on and just laying it down on the job site.”

The rebound in tech stocks has pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +2.19% out of the bear market it entered last year, but there is little evidence from the recent spate of earnings reports that growth has returned to the levels that justified tech’s pricey valuations. Investors seem to be betting on the unproven theory of a second-half rebound and near-term results from AI, while much of the tech sector — that is, just about every company not named Nvidia — still has a lot to prove about their near-term results and how AI will benefit their bank accounts.

Did earnings justify the tech-stock rebound?

As tech earnings season nears an end, we have seen stocks rise more than the results. The combined results from Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.87% GOOGL, +0.92% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.44% , Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.41% , Meta Platforms Inc. META, +3.70% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.14% showed only slight revenue growth of 4% in the first calendar quarter, with total revenue of $373.2 billion, rising from $358.7 billion a year ago. That paltry 4% revenue growth pales in comparison with the double-digit growth of quarters past.

Net income fared slightly better, rising 7.5% to a combined net of $66.4 billion, up from $61.7 billion a year ago, but per-share earnings for Big Tech fell 5.3% from the same period in 2022 as companies continue to grow their share counts through stock compensation. Big Tech has so far outpaced the overall S&P 500 in revenue growth but saw a sharper decline in EPS.

Don’t miss: After a $2 trillion stock rebound, Big Tech wades into sea of uncertainty

Investors and analysts were still relieved by those results. After a $2 trillion rebound in the first quarter, shares of four of the top five companies were trading on average about 40% higher year to date, with Meta stock more than doubling as Wall Street applauded its massive cost-cutting moves. Both Alphabet and Apple hit 52-week highs last week. Nvidia, now close to reaching $1 trillion in market cap, may join the ranks of Big Tech soon, but it is not included in this data.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the quarter “a much better-than-feared earnings season for tech.” Overall strength in cloud computing helped Microsoft beat estimates amid a huge decline in the PC market, but Amazon signaled some concerns about AWS. A more stabilized internet advertising market helped Alphabet’s Google search and ad business. Meta saw its earnings decline, with only slight revenue growth, as the Facebook parent cut costs, but it gave a better-than-expected forecast. Apple saw a surprise jump in iPhone sales, fueled in part by strong performance in emerging markets.

“ ‘The economy has shown incredible resiliency over the past two quarters despite huge issues such as a banking crisis. Yet it’s quite possible that the wheels could fall off the bus with [third-quarter] earnings.’ ” — Maribel Lopez, Lopez Research principal analyst

“We were told it was going to be horrible, the market was going to crater, and what we saw was that tech is going to be more resilient,” Futurum’s Newman said.

Results from the largest tech companies papered over some overall weakness, however. According to Credit Suisse’s senior equities strategist, Manish Bangard, earnings for all tech companies included in the S&P 500 have underperformed when compared with the overall S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% .

Two weeks ago, with 85% of companies having reported, Bangard noted that revenue growth for S&P 500 companies was 3.7% and EPS was down 2.4%, while tech companies in the index saw revenue fall 3.1% and EPS fall 12%. The data did not include results from Nvidia and several others that reported this week.

The first quarter also saw many companies meeting or beating lowered expectations, and estimates are still being cut. According to FactSet and a MarketWatch analysis, analysts have cut their earnings estimates for half of the 72 tech companies in the S&P 500 since December. They have also cut estimates for 44 of those companies for 2024.

More from Therese: The streaming wars are destroying all that was good about streaming

As this column noted last month, the first-quarter earnings season for some tech companies was expected to be buoyed by cloud-computing projects, with one analyst noting she was worried about the summer.

“The economy has shown incredible resiliency over the past two quarters despite huge issues such as a banking crisis,” Maribel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research, said in a recent email. “Yet it’s quite possible that the wheels could fall off the bus with [third-quarter] earnings. We see softening demand in areas such as retail, housing etc., which can’t be good for the overall economy.”

Indeed, the macroeconomy, jitters about the state of some regional banks and a looming debt-ceiling crisis are adding uncertainty to the mix, with some companies such as Apple citing macroeconomic uncertainty as the reason they are not giving much of a forecast. None of the Big Tech companies have provided a full annual forecast, with many executives citing the uncertain economic environment for the lack of more guidance.

Even Nvidia, which made the markets move with its forecast, declined to give guidance beyond the current quarter. When MarketWatch asked Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress directly about her view beyond the current quarter, she would only say, “We have procured a substantial supply for the second half of the year. We have better visibility for a few quarters out. That is about as much as we can articulate now.”

Generative AI is now the ‘all-weather sport’

Newman noted that while investors are concerned about the macroeconomy, tech in many cases is going to be more appealing, especially now with the massive focus on AI. And Nvidia’s monster projection showed the promise of the technology.

Newman described the focus on generative AI as an “all-weather sport.” He also believes that generative AI, because it is being tested by the public in applications like Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, will be a great democratizer.

“It is being made available to companies smaller than ever before,” he said. “AI is going to find its way into companies, and it’s going to be the fastest disruption we have seen.”

On top of software companies like Microsoft MSFT, +2.14% and Alphabet’s Google that are offering AI embedded in search, tech firms ranging from chip makers to hardware makers to telecom companies will all eventually benefit from a big wave of investment in the technology, Newman noted. “When generative AI is done on the edge, that will force another wave of upgrades,” he said, referring to the eventual processing of AI queries on devices instead of in the cloud.

Quarterly reports were in some cases overshadowed by talk about artificial intelligence, but investors should know that the costs will arrive well before the benefits. Microsoft executives, for example, talked about higher capital spending on AI efforts. Alphabet too talked about higher spending for its data-center infrastructure, with AI also a part of that spending.

This is where the possibility of a bubble exists. While investors are betting that other companies will soon see the same type of returns on AI that Nvidia expects this quarter, those companies may actually be shipping their money to Nvidia in hopes of getting a return years down the line. Wall Street expects earnings and revenue growth to turn around in the second half of the year, but if most of the tech sector is focused on spending to build for the future, that will not happen.

So while AI captured the most attention from investors this earnings season, especially after the Nvidia euphoria, they need to remember that there could be turbulence for the next few quarters. And spending on AI itself is going to mean a big investment cycle before some rewards are seen. Meanwhile, regulators are looking at whether they can put any guardrails on AI applications at this point.

Big Tech may be a haven for investors right now, with some caveats. As Newman pointed out, there has been a disproportionate flow of money into the big names, because “they have the most competitive technological moats.”

That applies to long-term bets, though. If Wall Street estimates are any indication of the rest of the year, they are pointing generally to continued lowered expectations. And if the numbers we see the rest of the year fail to compare to Nvidia’s monster forecast, the trillions poured into tech so far in 2023 could disappear just as fast."
"Why Amazon, PayPal, and Apple Are No-Brainer Buys Right Now",Motley Fool,2023-05-27T16:00:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/27/why-amazon-paypal-and-apple-are-no-brainer-buys-ri/,"The stock market is on a growth path, with the Nasdaq Composite index up 24% since Jan. 1. The market is benefiting from gradually easing inflation after countless stocks experienced steep declines amid an economic downturn last year. As many companies begin to recover, now is an excellent time to diversify your portfolio by investing in businesses most likely to profit from the improving cost of living.

Industries such as e-commerce, cloud computing, and consumer tech have massive potential as inflation eases, and both shoppers and businesses can spend more freely. So, with that in mind, here's why Amazon (AMZN 4.44%), PayPal (PYPL 1.43%), and Apple (AAPL 1.41%) are no-brainer buys right now.

1. Amazon

As the king of e-commerce with its leading 38% market share, Amazon's stock could surge alongside an improving economy. The company has immense dominance in the sector, proven by Walmart's second-largest market share of 6.3%.

Amazon has much to gain as online retail sales rise, and its business is already showing signs of recovery. The company's e-commerce business suffered from macroeconomic challenges last year, with its North America and international segments reporting $10.6 billion in operating losses in fiscal 2022. However, in the first quarter of 2023 Amazon's North America segment returned to profitability, hitting $898 million in operating income, while its international earnings also marginally improved.

In addition to e-commerce growth, Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), will likely benefit from easing inflation and a current boom in artificial intelligence. AWS has experienced slowing growth as rising interest rates have led to a pullback in cloud spending. However, Amazon's recently announced plan to invest $13 billion in expanding AWS in India is a promising step in the right direction.

Amazon's potential is reflected in its average 12-month price target of $138, which projects stock growth of 15% and makes its stock an attractive buy right now.

2. PayPal

In the world of online payment software, PayPal has a massive lead. The company's market share was 45% as of last September, with the second-largest share being Stripe with 19%.

However, the company has fallen out of favor with Wall Street in recent years. Investors have grown weary after PayPal parted ways with eBay in 2018, the market has grown more competitive, and tech giants like Apple have launched custom payment systems. As a result, PayPal shares are down 25% over the last five years.

Despite recent challenges, the company's position at the top of the market has provided consistent financial growth. Since 2019, PayPal's annual revenue has risen by 78%, while its operating income has climbed by 62%. As a result, the company's stock tumble has made it a bargain. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio has decreased by almost 40% in that last year and sits at an attractive 12.

As inflation improves, PayPal's considerable market share and partnerships with e-commerce leaders like Amazon and Walmart make it well positioned to offer major stock gains.

3. Apple

Apple is one of the easiest stocks to recommend, thanks to its history of reliable growth. The tech giant's stock has risen 1,000% over the last decade as it has attained a leading market share in multiple areas of consumer tech.Apple now boasts the largest smartphone market share after surpassing Samsung last year.

The achievement has boosted the company's position across the industry, gaining leading market shares in tablets, headphones, and smartwatches. Apple devices exist in an interconnected ecosystem that promotes ease of use and keeps consumers returning to its products. The strategy means iPhone users are significantly more likely to choose Apple products such as a MacBook or Apple Watch over competing equivalents.

The company's immense brand loyalty strengthens its outlook, considering Apple is expected to venture into the virtual/augmented reality market next month with the release of a new headset. The company's history of success when entering new industries suggests it could soon be atop the quickly expanding $31 billion market.

As a result, now is an excellent time to consider investing in Apple's stock ahead of its upcoming product launch."
"The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",Motley Fool,2023-05-28T09:10:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/28/the-best-stocks-to-invest-1000-in-right-now/,"The stock market has been recovering slowly but steadily in 2023 after last year's battering. This is evident from the 7% gains that the S&P 500 has logged so far this year despite facing multiple headwinds -- such as the banking crisis in the U.S., the debt ceiling, and the potential for a recession.

However, this year's stock market recovery is not without reason. Cooling inflation, the Federal Reserve's decision to slow the pace of rate hikes, and hot trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) seem to have encouraged investors to park their funds in stocks once again. And that seems to be the right thing to do, as the stock market has historically averaged robust returns despite periods of volatility.

So if you have $1,000 to spare right now, which means that your bills are paid, you have enough savings for a rainy day, and there is no high-interest loan to service (such as credit card debt), it may be a good time to use that money to buy some top companies that could deliver healthy returns in the long run.

In this article, we will look at a couple of names that you might want to consider buying with $1,000 of your investable cash, either individually or combined.

This tech giant is built for long-term growth

Apple (AAPL 1.41%) is the world's most valuable company by market capitalization, and that's not surprising given how it has been navigating a challenging smartphone market. The tech giant's revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (for the three months ended April 1, 2023) came in at $95 billion, down just 3% from the prior-year period despite its significant reliance on the smartphone market.

That's because Apple's smartphone shipments fell just 2.3% year over year in the first quarter of 2023, which was a much smaller decline compared to the 14.6% decline in overall smartphone shipments. As a result, Apple now controls 20.5% of the smartphone industry's shipments, second only to Samsung, which holds a 22.5% market share.

However, Apple's terrific smartphone pricing power explains why the company has been able to corner nearly half of the industry's revenue and 85% of the profits. The iPhone commands an average selling price (ASP) of almost $1,000, and the figure has been increasing at a time when the industry is under duress.

This bodes well for Apple's future, as the smartphone market's revenue is expected to head significantly higher by the end of the decade. Spherical Insights estimates that the global smartphone market could generate $947 billion in annual revenue by 2030, compared to $520 billion in 2021. If Apple manages to corner half of that massive revenue opportunity, its iPhone revenue could jump to nearly $475 billion a year. That would be more than double the company's fiscal 2022 iPhone revenue of $205.5 billion.

It wouldn't be surprising to see Apple hit that mark considering that it is expanding in lucrative markets such as India and is reportedly looking to enter new smartphone niches such as foldable devices, both of which could substantially boost its revenue in the long run. Throw in the fact that Apple is recording consistent growth in the highly profitable services business, and it is easy to see why the company could be a long-term winner.

Apple has turned a $1,000 investment into more than $3,800 in the past three years (assuming the dividends were reinvested), and it could replicate this terrific performance in the future as well.

Programmatic advertising's growth could help this stock fly higher

The Trade Desk (TTD 2.13%) is another high-flying stock that has turned a $1,000 investment into just over $8,000 in the past five years. The company has won big from the growing adoption of programmatic advertising, which allows brands and advertisers to automate their ad buying and campaign management. For instance, programmatic ad spending in the U.S. nearly doubled to $95 billion last year from $49 billion in 2018.

The Trade Desk has benefited substantially from the market's growth.

The programmatic advertising market still has a lot of room for growth. This space is expected to clock annual growth of 32% over the next five years and generate a whopping $2.7 trillion in revenue. That's not surprising, as The Trade Desk predicts all advertising media will eventually become programmatic and will be transacted digitally.

This explains why the company sees the total global advertising spending of $830 billion as its addressable market. More importantly, The Trade Desk's programmatic platform has allowed it to outgrow the digital ad market significantly. That trend is likely to continue, as the company's use of AI to help advertisers and brands improve their returns on advertising spend is likely to help it attract more users.

In all, considering the huge market opportunity that The Trade Desk is sitting on, it could continue to grow at a terrific pace in the long run. Its trailing 12-month revenue stands at just $1.65 billion, compared to the massive addressable market on offer, which tells us why analysts are expecting an acceleration in the company's growth.

Of course, investors will have to pay a premium if they want to buy this growth stock. The Trade Desk is trading at an expensive 20 times sales following its terrific gains of 47% so far in 2023. But it is still available at a discount to its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 26. The company's prospects indicate that it could sustain its impressive growth in the long run, which is why it may be a good idea for growth-oriented investors to put their money in The Trade Desk."
3 Things About Meta Platforms That Smart Investors Know,Motley Fool,2023-05-27T11:33:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/27/3-things-about-meta-platforms-that-smart-investors/,"Most investors likely recognize Meta Platforms (META 3.70%) as the social media titan that reaches more than 3.8 billion people monthly through Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. They also probably know it's struggled over the past year with Apple's (AAPL 1.41%) privacy update on iOS, which crippled its ability to craft targeted ads from third-party data, and intense competition from ByteDance's TikTok, which lured away a lot of its younger users.

Meta is still a divisive stock. The bulls believe it can overcome its near-term challenges with new advertising tools and Reels' short videos, while the bears see it as an aging tech giant which is losing its relevance in a changing world. I discussed Meta's strengths and weaknesses in previous articles, but today I'll dive deeper into three other aspects of Meta's business that smart investors should also be familiar with: its VR plans, its AI ambitions, and its interest in challenging Twitter.

1. It will keep burning billions of dollars in the metaverse

Meta's Reality Labs division, which houses its VR and AR products, has burned billions of dollars over the past four years:

Reality Labs Metric 2019 2020 2021 2022 Revenue $501M $1.14B $2.27B $2.16B Operating Loss ($4.50B) ($6.62B) ($10.19B) ($13.72B)

That spending might have seemed justified when its Reality Labs revenues were soaring from 2019 through 2021, but the segment's growth ground to a halt in 2022. Meta initially gained some traction among mainstream consumers with its launch of the stand-alone Quest VR headset in 2019, and that momentum continued with the launch of its smaller and more powerful Quest 2 headset in 2020. Meta also attempted to capitalize on the Quest's popularity by launching more VR games and connecting its VR users to each other through its Horizon Worlds VR playground.

Meta recently claimed to have sold about 20 million Quest headsets over the past four years, but Horizon Worlds only reportedly hosted about 200,000 monthly users in late 2022. Therefore, it seems like a lot of people simply tried out the Quest instead of sticking with it. That's troubling since Meta is likely selling the Quest at a loss in hopes of covering its costs through its sales of higher-margin VR applications. There are also other signs this nascent market is flickering out: According to CSS Insight, global shipments of VR and AR devices tumbled 9.6% in 2022.

Yet Meta remains committed to expanding this money-losing business. During its latest conference call in April, CFO Susan Li predicted the Reality Labs segment's operating losses would ""increase year over year in 2023."" CEO Mark Zuckerberg also reiterated his belief that ""building the metaverse is a long-term project.""

2. It's developing its own AI chips

Meta's data centers currently use Nvidia's (NVDA 2.54%) high-end GPUs to accelerate their machine learning and AI tasks. But it's also been developing an in-house custom AI chip that could replace some of Nvidia's chips by 2025.

These Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chips will be programmable ASIC chips that can be customized for specific tasks. And unlike the current setup for AI processing -- which generally requires a GPU to accelerate tasks for a CPU -- these ASIC chips could handle all of those tasks on their own without stand-alone CPUs or GPUs.

Meta recently poached an AI chipmaking team from the British chip designer Graphcore to accelerate the development of these in-house chips. Nvidia's investors should pay close attention to that move since Graphcore previously claimed its ""graph processing"" approach can tackle AI tasks more efficiently than CPUs or GPUs. Meta's AI chipmaking efforts might squeeze its near-term margins, but they could also enable its data centers to operate more efficiently over the long term.

3. It could challenge Twitter in the near future

Lastly, Meta has reportedly been testing out a Twitter-like app for Instagram. The details are sparse at the moment, but it could be a decentralized text-based platform that works with Twitter's smaller competitor Mastodon and other apps.

If Instagram actually launches that app, it could capitalize on the chaos at Twitter and gain some traction as an alternative ""town square"" app. It could also enable it to capture more first-party data to craft better-targeted ads.

Which of these issues will move the needle the most?

These three things probably won't matter as much as Meta's near-term challenges with Apple and TikTok. However, investors should still keep a close eye on its steadfast commitment to AR and VR products -- which will either end in a financial disaster or give it a firm first mover's advantage in those two next-gen markets. Its development of AI chips and a clone of Twitter are worth keeping an eye on, but they probably won't move the needle as much as its ambitious metaverse plans."
Here's How Much Warren Buffett's 4 Big Stock Buys Just Boosted Berkshire Hathaway's Dividend Income,Motley Fool,2023-05-24T08:57:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/heres-how-much-warren-buffetts-4-big-stock-buys-ju/,"Warren Buffett is a big believer in dividend-paying stocks. Even though the company he leads, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.55%) (BRK.B 0.49%), doesn't pay dividends, many of the businesses in which it invests feature extensive dividend income.

Berkshire Hathaway recently announced its latest individual stock holdings through its 13-F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing revealed changes to Berkshire's portfolio during the first quarter of 2023, and during that period, Berkshire added shares of several notable dividend payers. By doing so, Berkshire boosted its potential annual dividend income by more than $80 million. Here's the breakdown.

HP: $17.3 million extra

Computer printer and hardware company HP (HPQ 1.29%) has quietly become a major position in Berkshire's portfolio. With almost 121 million shares of HP, Berkshire owns about 12% of the tech business, with a value of about $3.5 billion based on recent prices. Berkshire just bought an additional 16.48 million shares during the first quarter of 2023.

HP pays its shareholders $0.2625 per share in dividends each quarter, which works out to a yield of more than 3%. The position in the printer specialist pays out about $127 million in dividends, and the shares that Berkshire just bought will add $17.3 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire.

Apple: $19.6 million extra

Berkshire's largest individual stock holding by far is Apple (AAPL 1.41%). The conglomerate holds a roughly 5.8% stake in the iPhone maker, and the market value of the 915 million Apple shares it owned as of March 31 was more than $150 billion. Buffett made an incremental purchase of 20.42 million shares of Apple stock during the period.

Apple's dividend yield of just over 0.5% isn't all that impressive, but it still puts plenty of cash into Berkshire's coffers. At $0.24 per share each quarter, Apple's dividends amount to nearly $879 million in annual income. The added shares purchased just in the first three months of 2023 should add more than $19.6 million in cash over the next year -- and that's assuming that the tech company doesn't boost its payout even further in the interim.

Bank of America: $20 million extra

Yet beating out Apple in the dividend department is Bank of America (BAC 0.50%). Berkshire added 22.75 million shares of BofA stock during 2023's Q1. With a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, that should contribute just over $20 million in additional dividend income annually. Berkshire's total position of 1.033 billion shares generated about $909 billion in dividends.

Buffett has actually sold off many of Berkshire's bank stock holdings recently. But Bank of America remains a favorite, and even though the total market value of Berkshire's BofA position is under $30 billion, the 3.1% dividend yield is much higher than Apple's, allowing the bank stock to cement its position as a leading contributor of dividend income for the Buffett-led insurance giant. Berkshire also controls about 13% of BofA's outstanding shares, which shows the confidence that the Oracle of Omaha has in the Charlotte-based banking giant.

Capital One Financial: $23.8 million extra

Continuing the bank theme, Berkshire added shares of Capital One Financial (COF 2.93%) for the first time during 2023's Q1. Purchases of 9.922 million shares represent just a 2.6% stake in Capital One, but they represent nearly $1 billion in value.

Moreover, with a $0.60 per-share quarterly dividend, Capital One boasts a 2.4% dividend yield. With such a massive investment, Berkshire boosted its annual dividend income by more than $23.8 million. Given an inexpensive valuation, Buffett likely believes Capital One can rise in value at the same time that it keeps paying out dividend income.

Don't forget the dividends

Even if you don't need dividend income from your portfolio to pay for your living expenses, it can still be valuable to invest in dividend stocks. With the cash they pay out, you can make additional investments and increase your income even further. That's been a winning strategy for Warren Buffett , and it's one you should closely consider as well in your own investing."
"1 Super Stock That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the $1 Trillion Club",Motley Fool,2023-05-24T10:01:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/1-stock-apple-microsoft-amazon-alphabet-1-trillion/,"In 1901, United States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company. But by 1955, vehicle manufacturing was the largest creator of value, with General Motors beating every other company in the world to a $10 billion market capitalization.

There was another changing of the guard in 1995, when industrial conglomerate General Electric became the first-ever $100 billion company. It offered everything from financial services to household appliances.

The technology sector reigns supreme today. In 2018, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the first to amass $1 trillion in value, and it has since been joined by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG).

As you can tell, the $1 trillion club is very exclusive, and some companies are currently closer to joining than others. I'm going to reveal one that seems like a long shot, but it has a growing number of opportunities that could catapult it into those ranks.

Uber Technologies (UBER 1.32%) is worth just $79 billion today, so its stock will deliver a 1,116% return for investors if it grows to become a $1 trillion giant. Here's why I think it will.

Here's where Uber stands today

Uber operates in three segments: mobility (ride-hailing), food delivery, and commercial freight. It serves more than 130 million customers on its platform each month. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, they booked a whopping 2.1 billion trips across mobility and food delivery.

Uber is the undisputed global leader in ride-sharing, which is the largest driver of the company's revenue. And now it's using that expertise to build the world's largest logistics network as well, through its Uber Freight platform.

It's having some early success, with over $17 billion in freight under management from 200,000 customers so far. That's a drop in the bucket compared to its opportunity, though, which totals $884 billion in the U.S. trucking sector alone.

On the whole, Uber's business is doing great right now!

But Uber is about to enter a new multitrillion-dollar industry

Wall Street firm Ark Investment Management, which is led by popular technology investor Cathie Wood, thinks the future of ride-hailing is the driverless vehicle. It believes fully autonomous-driving vehicles will dominate the industry, and Ark Invest sees Tesla (TSLA 4.72%) delivering its first robo-taxi as soon as this year.

But Uber might already have the upper hand. It abandoned its in-house autonomous-driving segment in 2020 and partnered with a company called Motional in 2022 on a 10-year deal instead. Motional is a joint venture between South Korean automaker Hyundai (HYMTF 0.62%) and mobility technology company Aptiv (APTV 2.70%), and together they have built an advanced self-driving vehicle.

It has already achieved Level 4 capabilities, which means it can navigate and drive without any human intervention whatsoever.

Since Uber already has over 130 million monthly active users in its ecosystem, its transition to autonomous ride-sharing will be seamless. Competitors like Tesla, on the other hand, need to build their own software applications so customers can call a ride, and it could take years to acquire enough users to dent Uber's dominance.

Ark believes autonomous ride-hailing companies will generate $4 trillion in annual revenue as soon as 2027, creating $14 trillion in enterprise value in the process. It looks like Uber is in the driver's seat already.

Here is Uber's (mathematical) path to a $1 trillion valuation

Despite Uber's historical success and its potentially lucrative future opportunities, investors aren't giving its stock much credit. Based on the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $33.8 billion and its current market cap of $79 billion, the stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 2.3.

That's far below its peak of 8, which it achieved during the tech boom in 2020. For the sake of this thought experiment, let's assume the stock trades at an average P/S of 4 over the long term, which means it will have to generate $250 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.

Uber could get there by the year 2033 if it can grow its revenue by at least 22.1% annually between now and then. It's not out of the question considering the company has grown its revenue by 32% over the last five years despite a pandemic and a weak economy standing in the way.

Don't forget, Ark Invest believes companies in autonomous ride-hailing could generate $4 trillion in revenue as soon as 2027, which means Uber only has to capture 6.2% of that market to achieve $250 billion in that one segment alone! Since it already has a 37% global market share in ride-sharing overall, it should be a piece of cake.

Uber has a real shot at joining Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the $1 trillion club over the long run, and if it does, investors who buy the stock today stand to earn a whopping 1,116% return."
2 Dividend Stocks Putting More Money in Investors' Pockets,Motley Fool,2023-05-24T12:15:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/2-dividend-stocks-putting-more-money-in-investors/,"Are you a shareholder of either Apple (AAPL 1.41%) or ASML Holding (ASML 3.87%)? If so, congratulations: You recently became incrementally richer. As is their habit, both companies recently declared dividend raises. Still, while this means a bit more coin in the bank accounts of their investors, it doesn't necessarily mean either company is investment-worthy today.

So let's put Apple and ASML under the microscope and see if they pass inspection.

1. Apple

It's a little hard to imagine these days, but for the first few decades of its existence, Apple was basically a pure-play tech hardware company. It had a regularly refreshed lineup of personal computers that usually won praise for their quality and utility although the company never became a No. 1 producer of mass-market machines.

These days, of course, Apple is an electronics and consumer-goods powerhouse that has sprouted thick branches from that trunk of original computer tech. We see iPhones everywhere, and it's not unusual for a household to have more than a single iPad tablet. Ever bold, the tech giant has pushed confidently into other product categories such as smartwatches and even computer chips.

Apple has cleverly positioned itself as a broadening electronics retailer whose products all operate on the same software platform. With this, its mighty App Store draws billions of dollars in revenue from the software you and I have on our iDevices, be it purchase charges, in-store buys, or subscriptions. The iOS operating system will continue to be foundational, and those apps and commerce opportunities will keep coming.

The King of Cupertino has been on its throne for a long time now, but it still seems like it has plenty of growth in store. Across all of its fiscal 2022, Apple managed to increase its net sales by 8%, with net income improving by 5%.

Macroeconomic strains and supply issues have dinged 2023 results so far, but that should reverse in the next year. On average, analysts are modeling 6% growth on the top line for 2024 and, much better, almost 10% improvement in per-share net income.

So is it any wonder that Apple just pulled the trigger on yet another dividend raise? The new quarterly disbursement is $0.24 per share, 4% higher than its previous payout. This was paid on May 18.

While the enhanced amount doesn't make it the highest yielder on the scene (at under 0.6%), it represents the 11th straight raise for the company, which seems fully determined to keep rewarding its shareholders.

2. ASML

In contrast to the overly familiar Apple, ASML is quite the under-the-radar stock. Based in the Netherlands, the company produces the photolithography machines used to make computer chips. In fact, it's the sole maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) devices, the only machines that can produce certain types of advanced chips.

As you might imagine, this is a monster business in a world stuffed full of smart devices, servers, and computers. Enduringly strong demand for chips keeps pushing ASML's financials ever higher. In its first quarter, the company reaped $7.3 billion in revenue, a very high leap over the $3.8 billion a mere one year prior. Not to be outdone, net income came in nearly three times higher, at $2.1 billion, against $750 million from a year ago.

As a result, ASML is a highly profitable company that throws off a lot of cash. It likes to direct some of this to its shareholders, and recently it rewarded them with -- you guessed it -- a dividend raise. The company's quarterly payout now stands at 1.69 euros ($1.82) per share, a robust 23% higher than the 1.37 euros ($1.49) it was distributing previously.

ASML's dividend raise kicked in with the quarterly payout dispensed on May 10. At the most recent closing share price, the new amount yields just over 1%.

None of this is a fluke or a one-off. ASML is facing the ""good problem"" of being too popular -- to the point where at the end of the first quarter, its order backlog was an intimidating $42 billion. That's nearly double the revenue it earned in all of 2022. How's that for popularity? Particularly with an explosion in the appeal and prominence of artificial intelligence (AI), consumers' devices will need ever more computing power.

ASML is guiding for 25% growth on the top line for 2023 compared to the previous year. Profitability should continue to be strong, ringing in at a gross margin of around 50%. We can easily imagine more double-digit growth in future years. With that kind of potential, ASML looks like a great stock to own, and now looks like a good time to own it."
2 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2023 and Beyond,Motley Fool,2023-05-24T11:26:01Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/2-leading-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-2023-and-beyond/,"After a sell-off in 2022, tech stocks are on the rise this year. Markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) have caught the eye of Wall Street. These technologies have the potential to affect the futures of countless industries, from consumer tech to healthcare, machine learning, education, and more. As a result, this year is an exciting time to load up on the tech companies that are building the future.

Here are two leading tech stocks to buy in 2023 and beyond.

1. Advanced Micro Devices

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 5.55%) is one of the world's most in-demand chipmakers, and its stock is an increasingly attractive investment. Technological advances have made more powerful chips crucial to the development of several industries. As a result, demand for AMD's central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and data processing units (DPUs) could soar as tech continues to evolve.

The semiconductor company's chips have allowed it to partner with titans of the industry to strengthen and diversify its business. In 2020, AMD became the exclusive supplier of chips for two of the most popular game consoles, Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, the company's data center chips have attracted cloud giants like Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle as clients.

However, one of the biggest reasons to invest in AMD is the support it is receiving from Microsoft to expand its AI chip offerings. According to a Bloomberg report from May 4, the Windows company is bolstering AMD's AI presence through financing and providing engineering resources in an effort to create an alternative to Nvidia.

The partnership is promising because Microsoft is one of the biggest names in AI right now; it invested $1 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019 and another $10 billion this year. The alliance has allowed Microsoft to integrate the start-up's AI technology into several of its services, such as its Office productivity software, Azure, and search engine Bing. As a result, Microsoft could be an excellent guide to help bolster AMD's AI expansion.

The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, suggesting that there will be plenty of market share up for grabs as AMD develops in the sector. Meanwhile, AMD's forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.2 suggests its stock is still significantly undervalued, making it worth an investment this year.

2. Apple

Apple (AAPL 1.41%) is the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion, and it might seem as if the best time to invest in it has passed. However, the company's dominance across several areas of consumer tech and a booming services business make its stock worth considering.

Apple shares have climbed nearly 1,000% since 2013. The company's consistent growth has primarily stemmed from its ability to rise to the top of nearly any industry it enters. It has attained a leading market share in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones despite other tech companies controlling those markets before Apple entered the picture.

As a result, the iPhone company's expected venture into the VR/AR market next month is an exciting development. According to data from Statista, the VR/AR market is projected to hit $31 billion this year and grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2027. The sector is currently dominated by Sony and Meta Platforms with their respective headsets. However, Apple's new device will offer connectivity with its other products and is expected to feature an iPhone-like interface, which could go a long way in attracting consumers.

Moreover, Apple services (Apple TV+, Music, iCloud, Fitness+, and more) have become an increasingly lucrative way for the company to diversify its earnings and lean less on product sales in the event of a market downturn. The consistent rise of iPhone adoption has spurred its services business, with the segment's revenue rising 63% since the first quarter of 2020 and offering attractive profit margins of around 70%.

Apple has a reputation for consistent stock growth, making it one of the most reliable investments available. Bolstered by a potential venture into a new market, the company's stock is a stellar buy in 2023 and beyond."
Is Apple Stock Overbought? The Answer May Surprise You.,Motley Fool,2023-05-27T14:31:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/27/is-apple-stock-overbought-the-answer-may-surprise/,"With shares of tech giant Apple (AAPL 1.41%) up more than 32% year to date, some investors might be wondering if the stock has become overvalued. After all, revenue or earnings didn't grow during this period. On the contrary, they contracted.

The stock's big gain, therefore, has been driven solely by valuation multiple expansion. Is the big move justified? Or is it time for shareholders to take some profit off the table?

Despite the stock's sharp and rapid rise this year, shares not only don't look overbought, but they arguably appear attractive.

Some context is in order

First, it's worth noting that the stock's recent gain is more of a recovery than a run-up. Put another way, the iPhone maker's shares aren't getting ahead of themselves this year; they're just recovering.

Indeed, Apple shares are still about 5% below their all-time highs. The stock's highest levels were actually more than a year ago, on Jan. 3, 2022. On this day, the stock price crossed $180.

The big thing that pulled Apple stock down leading up to its surge higher during the first half of 2023 was a broader-market decline, particularly in tech. This is evidenced by the S&P 500's 19% pullback last year and the outsize decline of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which plummeted 33% during the year.

A compelling valuation

Recent stock price movements may provide context, but they lack the substance needed for an investor to be as informed as they need to be in order to form an opinion on whether a stock is a buy, sell, or hold. Investors should go deeper and look at Apple stock's valuation. On this front, the tech stock scores quite well.

At first glance, a price-to-earnings ratio of 29 might seem a bit excessive for a company struggling to grow revenue and earnings in recent quarters. But investors should realize that Apple is coming off of a period of extraordinary growth.

For example, though trailing-six-month revenue and earnings per share declined 4% and 6% year over year, respectively, revenue and earnings per share in the 12-month period ending one year earlier rose 10% and 18% year over year, respectively. Looking further back to the same trailing-six-month period ended two years ago, Apple's revenue grew 34% year over year, and its earnings per share skyrocketed 63%. Growth like this in the rearview mirror is difficult to trump.

Historically, volatility in the company's growth rates has been normal. Apple reported negative year-over-year growth rates in 2016 and 2019, for instance. But when zooming out to Apple's longer-term trends, the tech giant has proven it can steadily grow its top line and earnings per share.

Analysts unsurprisingly expect similar trends over the next few years. The consensus analyst forecast calls for about 7% top-line growth in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 and earnings-per-share growth rates of 9% and 11% for those same years, respectively.

The stock's valuation is also supported by robust cash flow and an impeccable balance sheet. Apple's trailing-12-month free cash flow was more than $97 billion. Strong cash flow like this has helped the company build a balance sheet with $166 billion of cash and marketable securities.

Net of its long-term debt, Apple still has $57 billion of cash remaining. With a goal for its cash position to eventually equal its debt position, the company has plenty of excess cash -- and management is putting it to work with share buybacks and dividends.

All this said, shares don't look overbought at all. Indeed, today could prove to be a good time to buy in hindsight. There are risks, of course.

Investors, for instance, will want to watch the company's financial results over the next few years to ensure that Apple once again proves it can return to growth as it has following previous slowdowns in its business. If this growth fails to materialize, shares could underperform or even decline.

But given Apple stock's fairly conservative valuation, the company's long history of execution, its strong brand, and loyal customers, there's a lot to like about the stock today."
3 Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy in 2023 and Beyond,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:54:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/3-best-metaverse-stocks-to-buy-in-2023-and-beyond/,"The metaverse is a digital realm that transcends our understanding of reality. In this three-dimensional universe, people immerse themselves in a virtual environment and connect with others in the digital world. The technology has captured the imagination of many tech companies that are striving to make the metaverse a reality.

Investing in metaverse stocks requires patience. Its development could take years before reaching its full potential. According to McKinsey, the metaverse has the potential to generate $5 trillion in value by 2030. Citigroup thinks the opportunity could be worth a staggering $13 trillion by the same year.

There are companies making strides in the space that could be at the forefront of the metaverse's massive opportunity. Here are three stocks you should consider buying today to take advantage of the huge potential of this industry.

1. Meta Platforms

Meta Platforms (META 3.70%) has made a considerable commitment to the metaverse, rebranding its business from Facebook two years ago. It has poured billions of dollars into chasing the metaverse through its Reality Labs segment.

The company offers its Meta Quest virtual reality devices and software and metaverse-related content through the Meta Quest Store. It offers a platform for people to engage in virtual experiences, from gaming to fitness to entertainment.

The Reality Labs segment has been working on exciting technologies but has been a significant drag on earnings for Meta. Last year the segment lost $14 billion and another $4 billion in the first quarter.

Investing in the metaverse will require significant capital investment and may not be profitable for several years. However, Meta's Family of Apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, provide significant cash flow. Last year, these segments showed a profit of $43 billion, along with another $11 billion in the first quarter.

Meta Platforms is committed to investing significantly in the metaverse, and its other businesses ensure it can continue to do so -- making it a solid metaverse stock to buy today.

2. Unity Software

Unity Software (U 2.14%) provides creators a platform to create 3D development tools, allowing them to create interactive 3D, augmented, and virtual reality experiences. It expects to play a significant role in expanding metaverse content in the coming years. The company estimates half of the world's mobile, console, and PC games are created with its game development engine.

It offers two products, Unity Personal and Unity Student, for free to content creators who are just getting started. The company generates revenue through subscriptions to its platform, support, and services, and connects advertisers with creators to monetize their content.

Last year, Unity's revenue of $1.4 billion grew 25% from the year before. However, the company has struggled to turn a profit and lost $919 million during the year. In the first quarter, revenue grew 56% from last year, but its net loss increased to $254 million.

Unity is in growth mode and is racking up losses as it faces near-term headwinds. The stock has a promising future as a key player in the metaverse and presents an attractive investment opportunity for those with a long time horizon. Its high valuation and lack of profits make it best suited for investors willing to wait out its near-term growing pains for potentially excellent long-term returns.

3. Apple

The final metaverse stock to buy is Apple (AAPL 1.41%). Analysts expect Apple to announce its virtual reality headset during its Worldwide Developers Conference, which will begin on June 5. If it does, this product would be a massive move for Apple to add to its already impressive line of products.

According to Gizmodo, Apple's VR headset would be very different than other offerings in the market today in terms of functionality, available apps, and price. The device would use mixed reality or a combination of augmented and virtual reality and is expected to cost around $3,000. The move would be significant for Apple, which is already a behemoth with its $2.7 trillion market capitalization.

Like Meta, Apple has several other highly profitable businesses that provide excellent cash flow, allowing it to invest in building VR and related apps. Apple is already a stellar company, and its potential role in shaping the metaverse with its products is another reason the stock is solid to buy and hold long term."
Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:45:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/is-it-too-late-to-buy-apple-stock/,"Apple (AAPL 1.41%) has been on fire in 2023, driven higher by the remarkable resilience of the iPhone and a recovery by a broad cross section of technology stocks. Shares of the iPhone maker are up 32% so far this year, more than four times the 7% gains of the S&P 500. This marks a reversal of fortune for Apple, as its stock lost roughly 27% last year.

The biggest contributor to its gains so far this year was Apple's better-than-expected financial results. Investors were surprised by just how well sales of the iPhone held up, which suggests that the struggling economy -- which has weighed on the stock -- could soon rebound.

What does this mean for those who missed out on Apple's current rally? Is now the time to buy in expectation of additional gains or avoid the stock due to its valuation and the economic volatility that remains? Let's take a look.

What's been weighing on Apple stock?

It's no secret that the principal driver of stocks and the broader market indexes during the past year or so has been the current economic conditions. The bear market was fueled by 40-year-high inflation and the resulting interest rate hikes designed to keep higher prices at bay. The economic uncertainty caused a pullback in consumer spending, which has resulted in slowing sales of the iPhone -- Apple's biggest seller.

This was clear in Apple's performance in fiscal 2022 (ended Sept. 24, 2022). Full-year revenue grew just 8%. While still respectable, it was a far cry from the 33% gains the company generated in 2021. As alarming as this might be for some investors, it's important to note that this is typical of a downturn. History is clear that when the economy begins to recover -- as it no doubt will -- consumers will return to normal spending habits, which will most likely include upgrading to the latest Apple device.

This suggests that pent-up demand could drive Apple stock higher once consumer discretionary spending returns to normal.

What (else) could drive Apple stock higher?

In addition to a recovery in consumer spending, there are other catalysts that could fuel Apple's stock rally.

The tech giant has a large and growing cadre of active devices -- and that number continues to grow. Earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook revealed that Apple had amassed an installed base of 2 billion active devices while also hitting new all-time highs in each of its major product categories.

This translates to more revenue for the company, the result of its growing ecosystem. For example, iPhone users tend to visit the App Store, spending money on apps. They also avail themselves of other services, like paying using Apple Pay, streaming Apple TV+, or subscribing to Apple Music. Each of these apps makes Apple's ecosystem stickier, increasing the likelihood that not only will users stay around, they will also choose from the company's growing list of services -- thereby boosting revenue.

Another potential opportunity is Apple's long-rumored mixed-reality headset, which is expected to combine elements of virtual reality with augmented reality. While the company has yet to confirm the existence of this as-yet-to-be-released product, several major news outlets have suggested the device will be introduced during Apple's developer conference on June 5. Estimates vary widely regarding the expected price for the device, but most reports suggest a cost of about $3,000, with sales of about 1 million during the first year of release.

The jury is still out regarding the potential demand for such a product, but Apple has a strong track record of creating demand for products that many believed would be flops -- including the iPad and Apple Watch.

Apple is also expanding its presence in a number of emerging markets. The company just launched its online store in Vietnam and recently opened its first retail store in India, the world's second-largest smartphone market. These moves will help Apple tap into new and lucrative opportunities.

How to approach Apple stock now

Apple is currently selling for roughly 22 times trailing earnings, a lower valuation than the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 sported by the S&P 500. That's a pretty reasonable price to pay for a company with a strong history of growth.

As I illustrated above, Apple has a number of growth drivers that could spark a continuing stock rally over the longer term. Experienced investors with the discipline to withstand a little volatility should consider buying Apple now or adding to a position, particularly given the company's track record and the long runway ahead."

Meta Platforms, Inc (NYSE: META) tasted defeat in a lawsuit with European Union regulators who ordered vast amounts of data to help build an antitrust case against the Facebook parent.

On Wednesday, the EU General Court, the bloc's second-highest court, ruled that Meta had failed to prove that the request ""went beyond what was necessary,"" Bloomberg reports.

The case dates back three years to when the European Commission started examining Meta's sales platform and how it uses app data.

While Meta says it cooperated and handed over a million documents, the company prosecuted the EU's executive arm in 2020, citing the comprehensive nature of the data requests.

In 2020 the EU court ordered the EU to work with Meta and store information in a virtual data room.

Scrutiny of Meta added to EU probes into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN) mode of data collection from retailers, which by now was settled, and investigations into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) app store.

Apple : que se passe-t-il avec les écrans d’iPhone ?,Freenews.fr,2023-05-24T06:00:00Z,https://www.freenews.fr/freenews-edition-nationale-299/apple-que-se-passe-t-il-avec-les-ecrans-diphone,"Au milieu de l’anticipation croissante pour les futurs modèles d’iPhone d’Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), une déclaration récente de l’analyste renommé Ming-Chi Kuo suggère une situation potentiellement difficile pour les expéditions de Display Driver Integrated (DDI) de Novatek.

Il se passe quoi réellement ?

Lundi, Kuo, analyste chez TF International Securities, a révélé les perspectives du fournisseur d’Apple, Novatek, de manière assez surprenante, soulignant que les livraisons de composants DDI (Display Driver Integrated) pour iPhones seront potentiellement inférieures aux prévisions de l’année prochaine.

Kuo a imputé le déclin attendu à la prudence d’Apple dans l’ajout de nouveaux fournisseurs DDI, ce qui a entraîné une position conservatrice et pourrait avoir un impact sur le rôle de Novatek dans la chaîne d’approvisionnement de l’iPhone.

La réduction estimée des expéditions d’iPhone DDI de Novatek pour 2024 devrait dépasser 30%, ce qui pose un défi considérable à l’entreprise et fait penser aux réductions qui ont été opérées par Samsung sur certaines de ses filières de production, de l’ordre de 30% il y a encore quelques mois.

Kuo a également mis en lumière les défis auxquels sont confrontées les marques de smartphones Android.

Android, propriété d’Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) est en effet le premier système d’exploitation pour smartphones, avec une part de marché de 71,1%, devant iOS d’Apple, qui détient une part de marché de 27,6%.

Pourquoi c’est important

Apple a vendu pour 42,6 milliards de dollars d’iPhones l’année dernière au quatrième trimestre, soit moins que les 43,4 milliards de dollars attendus par les experts. Cependant, en annonçant les résultats et les revenus du quatrième trimestre d’Apple, le PDG Tim Cook a déclaré qu’il ne s’agissait pas d’une baisse de la demande ou des dépenses des consommateurs, mais de problèmes de chaîne d’approvisionnement.

Les résultats financiers d’Apple pour le quatrième trimestre de 2021 ont également été inférieurs aux attentes, le géant de la technologie ayant été confronté à des problèmes avec sa chaîne d’approvisionnement qui ont eu un impact sur les ventes d’iPhone, entraînant une baisse des revenus."
"Apple May Be Warren Buffett's Best Business, but It's Not His Favorite Stock to Buy -- This Is",Motley Fool,2023-05-24T09:06:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/24/apple-warren-buffett-not-his-favorite-stock-to-buy/,"Although Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.55%) (BRK.B 0.49%) isn't much of a household name, its CEO, billionaire Warren Buffett, certainly is. Since taking the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha has doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the S&P 500 (19.8% versus 9.9%). This substantial long-term outperformance is what coerces more than 30,000 investors and shareholders to trek to Omaha, Nebraska, every year to listen to Warren Buffett speak.

The latest Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting didn't disappoint. The traditional five-hour question-and-answer session that Warren Buffett and executive vice chairman Charlie Munger grant members of the audience usually results in invaluable nuggets of wisdom being passed along, as well as gaining added insight into Buffett's investment/analysis process.

Perhaps the biggest reveal during the 2023 annual meeting was the Oracle of Omaha's true feelings about tech stock Apple (AAPL 1.41%), which is a pillar for Berkshire Hathaway, but technically isn't the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy.

""A better business than any we own""

On one hand, all you have to do is pull up any of Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs to get a feeling for how Buffett and his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, ""feel"" about Apple. As of last week, Apple accounted for more than 47% of Berkshire's $333 billion of invested assets. This includes the more than 20 million additional shares of Apple added during the first quarter by Buffett and his team.

However, the Oracle of Omaha made sure not to mince his words when challenged about the idea of Apple accounting for a potentially dangerous share of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets during his company's annual meeting. Said Buffett:

But Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire's portfolio includes the railroad, the energy business, Garanimals, you name it, See's Candy. They're all businesses... They're good businesses. And to think that our criterion -- our criteria for Apple is different than the other businesses we own, it just happens to be a better business than any we own. And we put a fair amount of money in it, but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad. And Apple is a better business. Our railroad is a very good business. It was not remotely as good as Apple's business.

To be sure, Apple has checked all of Buffett's key points for some time. He certainly trusts the management team, which is headed by CEO Tim Cook. Not only is Apple continuing to lead the charge with the physical products that endeared the company with consumers (iPhone and Mac), but it's evolving with new subscription services. Apple's services segment should help the company minimize revenue fluctuations associated with iPhone replacement cycles, as well as bolster its operating margin over time.

Buffett also appreciates the value of a well-known brand. Apple is pretty consistently at or near the top of the list when it comes to brand value, and its customer base has proven exceptionally loyal. Subscription services should only enhance the loyalty of the company's customers.

And, of course, Warren Buffett's best business believes in rewarding its long-term shareholders. Apple is parsing out one of the largest nominal-dollar dividends among publicly traded companies, and it's repurchased a jaw-dropping $586 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. Not including itself, Apple has spent more buying back its stock since 2013 than the market caps of 493 out of the other 499 S&P 500 companies.

Move over, Apple! This is Warren Buffett's undisputed favorite stock to buy

But here's something you might not realize: Despite Buffett's love for Apple, it's not his favorite stock to buy. In fact, it's not even close.

Normally, perusing Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F filings will tell you everything you need to know about what Buffett and his investing lieutenants have been buying and selling. However, Berkshire's 13Fs aren't providing the complete picture regarding Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy (cue ironic music)... Berkshire Hathaway.

Prior to mid-July 2018, the Oracle of Omaha and his right-hand man Charlie Munger were only allowed to repurchase shares of their company's stock if it fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above book value). For more than a half-decade leading up to mid-July 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's stock never hit this mark, leading to no share buybacks.

On July 17, 2018, things changed in a big way. Berkshire's board passed new measures that gave Buffett and Munger significantly more discretion to buy back their company's stock. As long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet and both Buffett and Munger agree Berkshire's stock is trading below its intrinsic value, repurchases can be made with no ceiling or cap.

Since mid-July 2018, Buffett and Munger have overseen share buybacks every single quarter. During the recently ended first quarter, a little over 5,100 Class A shares were repurchased, along with close to 6.72 million Class B shares, which equated to almost $4.44 billion spent on share buybacks. In less than five years, Buffett has overseen the repurchase of $70 billion worth of his favorite stock, which is nearly double what's been spent purchasing shares of Apple since the beginning of 2016.

Since Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are an easy way to reward long-term investors. For starters, steadily buying back stock and lowering the outstanding share count increases the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. It's the same principle as Berkshire Hathaway becoming a large stakeholder in Apple without having to buy any additional shares.

What's more, buying back stock can have a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS). For businesses like Berkshire Hathaway that have steady or growing net income, a lower outstanding share count will provide a lift to EPS. Berkshire Hathaway is already a fundamentally attractive investment. Add on a stream of buybacks that boost its EPS over time, and it could become even more attractive.

Repurchasing $70 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock in less than five years is also a clear indication from Buffett and Munger that they're confident in the business they've built. Many of the companies Berkshire owns and has invested in are cyclical, which means they're poised to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.

Therefore, no matter how much the Oracle of Omaha praises Apple, there's absolutely no question that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy."

Take a Look Into How Apple-Broadcom Deal Puts ETFs in Focus,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-27T15:07:00Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-apple-broadcom-deal-puts-150700029.html,"On Tuesday, Apple AAPL revealed a significant partnership with Broadcom AVGO to collaborate on the development of 5G radio frequency components within the United States. The multi-billion dollar deal involves Broadcom working alongside Apple to create and manufacture these components in various American facilities, including their prominent factory in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Following the announcement, shares of Broadcom experienced about a 2.2% increase, reaching an all-time high. The market responded positively to the news, reflecting the favorable perception and confidence in Broadcom's prospects as a result of this development.

Let’s Dive into the Deal

According to an article on Reuters, Apple specifically highlighted its intention to leverage Broadcom's expertise in film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) chips. These FBAR chips play a crucial role in the radio-frequency system, enabling seamless connectivity between iPhones and other Apple devices and mobile data networks.

This development signifies the continuation of a longstanding partnership between Apple and Broadcom. Notably, in 2020, Broadcom had disclosed its plans to supply Apple with $15 billion worth of wireless components. As part of the new deal, Apple will not only benefit from Broadcom's components but also utilize the collaboration to invest in important automation projects and skill development for engineers and technicians.

The partnership is mutually beneficial, as Apple's existing support for over 1,100 jobs at Broadcom's Fort Collins, CO facility further strengthens their collaboration in FBAR filter manufacturing. In its most recent two fiscal years, Apple has emerged as a significant revenue contributor for the chipmaker, with roughly 20% of its total revenue stemming from its role as a major supplier of wireless components to Apple.

ETFs in Focus

Why Dish Stock Is Soaring Thursday,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-25T16:32:42Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dish-stock-soaring-thursday-163242527.html,"DISH Network Corp (NASDAQ: DISH) stock is up Thursday following reports of selling wireless plans for its nascent mobile phone service through Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The arrangement can potentially give the telecom company's 5G rollout a critical lifeline, the Wall Street Journal cites knowledgeable sources.

Dish stock's session volume reached 7 million vs. the average 100-day volume of 9.4.

Dish is already a customer of Amazon's cloud-computing services.

Also Read: Dish Comes Clean On February Hack: Affects Personal Info Of 300K Employees, Customer Details Unaffected

Dish voiced the need for Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone's operation on the company's new 5G network to tap the device's sizable market share.

Dish and its affiliates doled out $30 billion on mobile spectrum licenses, spending the past three years installing a nationwide network of cell towers and software with the latest 5G technology from scratch.

The potential deal allows Dish to market its service to millions of prospective customers and help Amazon expand its relatively small footprint in the consumer smartphone market.

Amazon has previously discussed potential wireless business deals with Dish.

Wireless plans sold through Amazon's e-commerce portal could eventually challenge rival cellphone carriers AT&T Inc (NYSE: T), Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ), and T-Mobile US, Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS) as they battle slowing subscriber growth following a pandemic-era boom.

In May, Dish reported a first-quarter FY23 revenue decline of 8.6% year-on-year to $3.96 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $4.06 billion. EPS of $0.35 missed the consensus estimate of $0.36.

The net decrease primarily resulted from the decline in revenue from its Pay-TV Wireless and Wireless segments.

Price Action: DISH shares traded higher by 12.50% at $7.01 on the last check Thursday.

84% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 7 Stocks,Motley Fool,2023-05-26T09:06:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/26/84-warren-buffett-portfolio-invested-in-7-stocks/,"Compared to most investors, Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.55%) (BRK.B 0.49%) Warren Buffett is in a class of his own. The billionaire CEO of Berkshire who took over in 1965 has overseen a cumulative gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of nearly 4,100,000% as of last weekend. Jaw-dropping increases like this tend to get you noticed on Wall Street.

But what's truly interesting about the Oracle of Omaha is his transparency. Buffett is an open book who's willingly shared the traits he looks for in businesses when making sizable investment decisions.

However, the one factor that's made Warren Buffett successful which isn't given nearly enough attention is his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both he and right-hand man Charlie Munger believe that diversification is only necessary if you don't know what you're doing. Despite overseeing a nearly $339 billion investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett has 84% of invested assets tied up in just seven stocks.

1. Apple: $160.4 billion (47.3% of invested assets)

It takes one short look at Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio to realize the Oracle of Omaha willingly invests big bucks into the businesses he values most. Tech stock Apple (AAPL 1.41%) accounting for more than 47% of invested assets, and Buffett and his team adding to Berkshire's position during the first quarter, demonstrates just how highly he thinks of the company.

From brand value to innovation, Apple does it all. According to Interbrand and Kantar BrandZ's ranking, it's the most valuable brand in the world. Apple has an easily recognized brand, a loyal customer base, and is trusted by consumers. The Oracle of Omaha puts a lot of value into businesses that build trust with consumers.

Most importantly, CEO Tim Cook has allowed Apple's innovation to do the talking. The iPhone has been revolutionizing the smartphone market for nearly 16 years, and now Apple's subscription-services segment is rapidly adding new users.

The cherry on top for Apple is that it's repurchased $586 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. That's greater than the market cap of 493 out of 500 S&P 500 companies.

2. Bank of America: $29 billion (8.6% of invested assets)

Although Apple is viewed as Berkshire Hathaway's best business, there's no sector Warren Buffett is more comfortable investing in than financials. More specifically, he loves dabbling in bank stocks, with Bank of America (BAC 0.50%) being his very clear favorite of the lot.

The simple reason Buffett loves banks is because they're cyclical. Though recessions are inevitable, periods of expansion last considerably longer than downturns. This allows companies like Bank of America (BofA) to expand their loans and deposits (i.e., the bread and butter for banking growth) and grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy.

As I noted earlier this week, BofA's calling card is its sensitivity to interest rates. While the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades hasn't been pleasant for consumers, it's great news for BofA and the variable-rate loans it has outstanding. BofA is bringing in billions of dollars in added net-interest income each quarter thanks to higher interest rates.

Don't overlook BofA's capital-return program, either. During periods of economic expansion, BofA can comfortably return (with Fed approval) $20 billion to $30 billion annually to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.

3. Coca-Cola: $25.1 billion (7.4% of invested assets)

The third-largest holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio is Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held stock, Coca-Cola (KO -0.25%). Coke has been a fixture since 1988.

Coca-Cola is another perfect example of a wholesome brand Buffett likes that's built trust with consumers. It's one of the most recognized consumer-staples brands globally and has operations in all but three countries worldwide. Having this sort of geographic diversity, to go along with 26 brands generating at least $1 billion annually, provides the consistency of cash flow that Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) have grown to love.

Something else Coca-Cola has is an exceptional marketing team year in and year out. At the moment, Coke is spending more than half of its advertising budget online to connect with a younger audience. But don't overlook its decades of holiday tie-ins and well-known brand ambassadors, which allow the brand to engage consumers of all ages.

Coca-Cola has also increased its base annual dividend for 61 consecutive years, which is an easy way to get on Buffett's good side.

4. American Express: $23.2 billion (6.8% of invested assets)

Credit-services provider American Express (AXP 4.08%) is another long-term holding that's been a marvelous investment for Warren Buffett and his team. AmEx is a continuous holding since 1993, and Berkshire is currently sitting on an unrealized gain (not including dividends) of about 1,700%.

American Express's secret sauce is what I like to call its ability to ""double dip."" It's the No. 3 payment processor in the U.S. by credit card network-purchase volume, which allows it to generate merchant fees, and benefit as the U.S. and global economy expand. However, it also acts as a lender, which helps the company generate interest income and annual cardholder fees.

Furthermore, American Express is adept at attracting well-to-do clients. Consumers with higher incomes are less likely to change their spending habits when inflation rises or the U.S. economy hits a speed bump. Targeting high earners means fewer disruptions to its cash flow.

Since Berkshire's cost basis on AmEx is just $8.49 per share, its $2.40 annual dividend payout equates to a 28% yield relative to cost.

5. Chevron: $20.6 billion (6.1% of invested assets)

Despite trimming its position in this company by more than 30 million shares during Q1, Berkshire Hathaway's fifth-biggest holding is energy stock Chevron (CVX -0.31%).

The only reason Buffett, Combs, and Weschler would collectively agree to put more than $20 billion to work in an integrated oil and gas company is if they believe the value of energy commodities will remain elevated. Certain macroeconomic factors do suggest crude oil prices could be sticky at high levels. For instance, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, coupled with three years of capital underinvestment by energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic, should restrict the supply of oil for years to come.

On the flipside, Chevron is an integrated energy company, which is a fancy way of saying it's hedged its operating performance in the event that crude oil and natural gas prices sink. In addition to drilling, Chevron operates transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. The latter two tend to enjoy lower input costs and higher demand when crude prices dip.

To keep with the theme, Chevron is big on returning capital to its shareholders. It's increased its base annual payout for 36 years in a row, and its board recently approved a $75 billion share-repurchase program.

6. Occidental Petroleum: $12.9 billion (3.8% of invested assets)

Another energy stock the Oracle of Omaha and his team can't stop buying of late is Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.22%). Berkshire Hathaway was given the OK from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in August to acquire up to a roughly 50% stake in Occidental should it choose to do so.

The investment thesis for Occidental Petroleum somewhat mirrors Chevron in that higher oil prices are favorable, and both are integrated energy operators. However, there are two key differences. The first is that Occidental is far more reliant on its drilling segment as a percentage of net sales. If oil prices rise or fall, Occidental would be expected to see bigger swings in its operating cash flow and probably its share price.

The other big difference can be seen on its balance sheet. Whereas Chevron has one of the lowest net-debt ratios in the oil and gas industry, Occidental Petroleum closed out March 2023 with $19.6 billion in net debt. Even though that's down considerably from two years prior, it's still a sizable hole the company needs to dig itself out of.

I'd be remiss if I didn't also note that Berkshire Hathaway holds $10 billion worth of Occidental preferred stock that yields 8% annually.

7. Kraft Heinz: $12.7 billion (3.8% of invested assets)

The seventh and final company that collectively adds up to 84% of Warren Buffett's investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is consumer-packaged goods company Kraft Heinz (KHC 0.21%).

The lure for Kraft Heinz is the company's vast portfolio of well-known, easy-to-prepare meals, snacks, and condiments, such as Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and of course, Grey Poupon. Companies with strong branding typically have the ability to generate predictable cash flow and pay a handsome dividend -- a 4.1% annual yield in Kraft Heinz's case.

Kraft Heinz was in the minority in that it benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic. With people staying home during the pandemic, easy-to-make meals and snacks flew off grocery-store shelves.

But this organic sales boost has its limits. Despite having significant pricing power, Kraft Heinz's volume/mix has declined in successive quarters from the prior-year period. This looks to be a signal that consumers are trading down to cheaper brands, which could mean trouble for Kraft Heinz in the coming quarters."

工業和金融股賣壓沉重，區域銀行重現拋售壓力。由於國際油價繼續受到石油輸出國組織及俄羅斯等產油盟國 (OPEC+) 減產預期支撐，能源股連續第二天逆勢收紅。

政經方面，美財政部長葉倫週三重申，美國財政部最快可能在 6 月 1 日耗盡現金，但很難確定具體哪一天耗盡現金。隨著人們越來越擔心美國可能出現歷史上的首次違約，她已看到金融市場存在一些壓力。

美國眾議院議長麥卡錫表示，他和美國總統拜登在打破債務上限僵局的諸多問題上仍存在很大分歧，共和黨已做出眾多讓步，不希望發生債務違約，已派談判代表前往白宮，希望在週三的會談中與民主黨會談取得進展。

聯準會發布的 5 月利率會議紀要顯示，官員們對是否支持進一步升息存在意見分歧、聯準會官員強調要依賴數據，而且今年不太可能降息。

該紀要提到，許多與會者強調需要在 5 月會議後保留選擇權，多位與會者表示，如果經濟按預期發展，可能不需要進一步收緊政策。

美國白宮國安會發言人柯比 (John Kirby) 週一 (20 日) 透露，白宮將與中國直接就中國制裁美光的行動展開對話，相信這不會對美中兩國關係構成重大影響。

華爾街分析

德銀分析師 Jim Reid 指出：「確實有人​​擔心這可能會一直持續下去，投資人逐漸加緊準備，也有人在談論現在是否需要短期延期來解決債限問題，但就目前而言，麥卡錫繼續淡化這種可能性。因此，投資人繼續緊張地等待，目前還沒有出現達成協議的跡象。」

50 Park Investments 執行長 Adam Sarhan 表示：「隨著 6 月 1 日最後期限臨近，由於買超情況和對不利債務上限結果的擔憂加劇，市場仍下跌回落。當恐懼佔據上風時，投資人往往會先行拋售，然後再提出疑問，這就是我們可能看到的情況。」

Nvidia Is At The Door Of The $1 Trillion Club,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-25T16:43:34Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-door-1-trillion-club-164334000.html,"On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares soared 26% upon strong first quarter results and AI-powered guidance that both shattered expectations, bringing its market value at close to $755 billion. On Thursday during premarket trading, they surged even 29%, bringing the company’s market value to $980 billion and the chipmaker very close to joining, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the $1 trillion club.

First Quarter Figures

Total sales did drop 13% from last year’s comparable quarter when they amounted to $8.29 billion. But revenue of $7.19 billion still topped the expected $6.52 billion.

With surged demand for its data center offerings, the graphics chip specialist saw the unit’s revenue rise 14% YoY to $4.28 billion, leaving expectations of $3.9 billion far behind. This positive demand trend is owed to Nvidia’s GPU chips that large internet and cloud companies needed to train and deploy generative AI applications, like the one from Microsoft, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Even Apple is betting big on this front as on Tuesday, it revealed has partnered with Broadcom in a multibillion-dollar deal to develop chips made in the U.S.

On the other hand, Nvidia’s gaming division experienced a 38% YoY drop in revenue to $2.24 billion, but still topped expectations of $1.98 billion. However, it is important to note that gaming revenue did jump 22% from the prior quarter with the PC market still being in a slump. But, this segment remains as hot as ever, with even the tech titan Microsoft wanting to become a gaming powerhouse by committing $70 billion as it hopes to buy Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ: ATVI).

The automotive division remains a small part of Nvidia’s business with sales lower than $300 million, but with a YoY growth of 114%.

Net income amounted to $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, rising significantly from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $1.62 billion, or 64 cents.

AI-Powered Q2 guidance

Management is expecting revenue to grow 64% YoY to $11 billion. Although adjusted EPS were not provided, based on the given inputs, Motley Fool found they are expected to consequently skyrocket 286% to $1.97 a share. Microsoft who is leading the AI front for now is also betting big on this technology to fuel its revenue growth, but over the long-term as the tech titan gave a downbeat outlook due to slowed down cloud demand, a concern that it shares with its cloud peer, Amazon.

As it goes for the Moon, Nvidia already reached the stars

Given the challenging macroenvironment that caused even Amazon to be cautious and Microsoft to provide lackluster guidance, Nvidia not only did extremely well considering the circumstances by recording record revenue but also managed to give an exhilarating outlook. Nvidia already had good prospects based on gaming and cloud computing, but with generative AI, it’s long-term potential reached a whole new level. At a recent Goldman Sachs and SV Angel event on artificial intelligence, Bill Gates claimed that the power of this technology is so profound that could lead to people never needing to use Google or visit a website go shop like Amazon anymore. CEO Jensen Huang certainly thinks the Nvidia is in all the right places, with shares having more than doubled this year.

〈美股早盤〉債務上限僵局令投資人不安 主要指數開低,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-24T05:53:51Z,https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/%E7%BE%8E%E8%82%A1%E6%97%A9%E7%9B%A4-%E5%82%B5%E5%8B%99%E4%B8%8A%E9%99%90%E5%83%B5%E5%B1%80%E4%BB%A4%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%8D%E5%AE%89-%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E6%8C%87%E6%95%B8%E9%96%8B%E4%BD%8E-135351359.html,"白宮和宮和黨代表就提高債務上限的新一輪談判未能取得突破，令投資人緊張不安，與此同時對全球經濟前景悲觀情緒日益加劇，美股主要指數周三（24 日）開低。

截稿前，道瓊工業指數下跌近 200 點或近 0.6%，那斯達克綜合指數跌近 90 點或 0.7%，標普 500 指數跌近 0.7%，費城半導體指數跌近 2%。

美國眾議院議長麥卡錫昨日表示，協議還沒有達成，但認為仍然可以在 6 月 1 日之前達成協議。據悉，雙方在支出方面仍存在重大分歧，目前沒有安排任何談判。據眾議院議長麥卡錫在當天的共和黨閉門會議上表示，他們離達成協議「還差得很遠」。評論稱債務談判的緊迫性因此大打折扣。聯準會（Fed）主席鮑爾與民主黨眾議員會面時對債務上限問題避而不談。

不過多家外媒援引知情人士消息指出，雙方將於美國時間周三上午重新談判，尋求就高美國 31.4 兆美元的債務上限達成協議，避免災難性的違約。

Fed 將於台灣時間周四兩點公布五月會議紀錄，投資人將密切關注 Fed 未來利率路徑的線索。該次會議上，Fed 進行此輪周期中的連續第十次升息，目前的焦點是 Fed 是否會在 6 月的會議上暫停升息。

Fed 主席鮑爾上周談話時提到，有鑑於近期一連串銀行倒閉造成信貸環境收緊，可能會暫停升息。然而，Fed「鷹王」布拉德日前表示，今年仍然需要在升息兩次，新「鷹王」卡什卡里也表示，Fed 應該在 6 月發出訊號，即便這此暫停升息也不意味著緊縮政策結束。

其他市場方面，英國通膨高燒難退，粉碎英國央行（BOE）暫停升息的預期。貨幣市場目前預估 BOE 的利率最高將達到 5.5%，這意味著年底前將整整升息 4 碼。

具體來看，英國 4 月消費者物價指數（CPI）年增 8.7%，高於預期 8.3%，前值為 10.1%，核心 CPI 年增 6.8%，高於預期與前值 6.2%。按月來看，4 月 CPI 成長 1.2%，高於預期與前值 0.8%，核心 CPI 成長 1.3%，也高於預期的 0.8% 與前值的 0.9%。

大宗商品方面，金屬價格普遍走低，倫敦交易所（LME）的銅庫存自 4 月中旬以來幾乎翻了一番，從這一點可以明顯看出銅需求疲軟。

截至台北時間周三（24 日）21 時許：

焦點個股：

蘋果 (AAPL-US) 早盤上漲 0.3%，至每股 172.07 美元

蘋果全球開發者大會（WWDC）將台灣時間 6 月 6 日至 10 日以線上方式舉行，開發者和學生有機會在開幕當天到加州 Apple Park 現場參加。其中今年 WWDC 最重要的主題演講定於台灣時間 6 月 6 日凌晨 1 點舉行，市場預估蘋果屆時將公布混合時境（MR）頭戴式裝置、15 吋 MacBook Air 以及 iOS、iPadOS、macOS 等一系列更新。

特斯拉 (TSLA-US) 早盤下跌 1.88%，至每股 182.27 美元

美國電動車龍頭執行長馬斯克日前表示，已向特斯拉董事會選定一位接班人，如果自己發生意外此人將接管公司，不過他並未透露這位接班人的姓名。特斯拉內部猜測，馬斯克屬意的下任特斯拉執行長很可能是目前的財務長 Zachary Kirkhorn。而近年來頗受馬斯克重用的高層，特斯拉中華區負責人朱曉彤也是可能的人選之一。

Alphabet(GOOGL-US) 早盤下跌 1.03%，至每股 121.30 美元

Alphabet 旗下 Google 日前發布一款新的對話式聊天機器人，它將協助廣告商製作廣告。Google 表示，廣告商可以輸入自己的網站，人工智慧（AI）聊天機器人將幫助草擬標題、選定特定關鍵詞和圖片來吸引消費者。

今日關鍵經濟數據：

無

華爾街分析：

加拿大皇家銀行 Brewin Dolphin 市場分析主管 Janet Mui 表示，預估美國經濟將步入衰退，因為預期利率將維持在高處，對經濟和企業利潤都是負面影響。這一看法與市場目前定價背道而馳，市場認為有鑑於就業市場仍強凸顯美國經濟仍有彈性、Fed 升息腳步放慢，有望實現「軟著陸」。

貝萊德國際 EMEA 基本固定收益部門主管 Michael Krautzberger 也對美國經濟前景感到悲觀，他認為隨著債務上限最後期限逼近，該問題帶來的波動是看淡前景的原因之一，但預料不會出現技術性違約，會在最後一刻達成協議。

Warren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, hasn’t earned the nickname “The Oracle of Omaha” for nothing. His company’s stock doubled the annual return of the S&P 500 from 1965 to 2022, returning 19.8% on average annually vs. the S&P 500’s 9.9%.

In addition to his folksy wisdom, Buffett is also known for his general reluctance to buy tech stocks. But what may surprise some investors is that one popular tech stock — with important exposure to artificial intelligence — actually makes up nearly half of the Berkshire Hathaway investment portfolio, and the company has small stakes in other AI-related companies as well. Here’s a look at some of the prominent AI stocks that Warren Buffett is betting on.

Apple (AAPL)

When it comes to AI-related stocks — and tech stocks in general — Apple is really the beginning and the end of the discussion. After shunning tech stocks for decades, Buffett made a major shift on May 16, 2016, picking up nearly 10 million shares of Apple at a split-adjusted price of about $6.81.

Now trading at about $171 per share, Apple has posted huge gains on Buffett’s original purchase. Although Buffett has occasionally trimmed Berkshire’s Apple position, it now sits at a whopping 47% of the company’s entire investment portfolio.

Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?

Regardless of what other AI stocks Berkshire might dabble in, it’s clear that the company’s big bet is on Apple.

Buffett has said he views Apple not as a tech company but as a consumer products business. In that field, Buffett sees Apple as the best of the best. In fact, at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting in May 2023, Buffett said Apple “just happens to be a better business than any we own.” Regarding Apple’s iPhone, Buffett said that if people “had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they give up their second car.”

Apple already has begun integrating AI into its product line. CEO Tim Cook said AI will eventually “affect every product and service we have.” Two of the company’s signature products, the iPhone and the Apple Watch, already use an AI-powered crash detection feature, and the Apple Watch also has an electrocardiogram feature.

In its quest to continue its dominance in the consumer products world, Apple seems poised to rapidly integrate AI into its stable.

Amazon (AMZN)

Amazon is Berkshire Hathaway’s other primary bet in the tech/AI industry, although it’s a far cry from the company’s love of Apple. Currently, Amazon represents just 0.4% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio — although it’s still a $1.2 billion investment.

Berkshire Hathaway began buying Amazon in 2019, and Buffett has said he was “an idiot for not buying it [sooner].” Even though the stock still appears in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio — and Buffett is a fan — the CEO wasn’t the one who actually initiated the position.

As Buffett told CNBC at the time, “One of the fellows in the office that manage money … bought some Amazon,” referring to either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, his two main portfolio managers.

Although Amazon might not seem like a “classic” Buffett stock, it does have many of the competitive advantages that he has long espoused. From the economic “moat” around its business — which is hard for competitors to breach — to its customer satisfaction levels and excellent management, Amazon has many of the characteristics that make it a so-called “Buffett stock.” But Amazon’s also becoming a big player in the AI world.

The company recently made a big splash with its rollout of Bedrock, a direct competitor of ChatGPT that could revolutionize the industry. As told to TechCrunch, Vasi Philomin, VP of generative AI at Amazon Web Services, said Bedrock will apply “machine learning to the real world — solving real business problems at scale. … We think every application out there can be reimagined with generative AI.”

Snowflake (SNOW)

A somewhat lesser-known AI name favored by Buffett is Snowflake. Representing just 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, the Snowflake position is worth “only” about $907 million. But it does reflect Buffett’s evolving opinion of the types of stocks he should own, even though it’s likely one of his portfolio managers did the actual buying.

Snowflake’s platform, according to the company itself, “was designed from the ground up to support machine learning and AI-driven data science applications.” The cloud data warehouse company stores, processes and analyzes company information in conjunction with prominent cloud platforms Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.

While this could position the company for explosive future growth, it’s possible that Berkshire Hathaway bought into Snowflake because it was able to get shares in what was a very hot IPO in 2020.

Walmart's Sam's Club has gone all in on AI. Will it help it get a leg up on Costco?,Yahoo Entertainment,2023-05-24T12:29:36Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmarts-sams-club-has-gone-all-in-on-ai-will-it-help-it-get-a-leg-up-on-costco-122936329.html,"Sam's Club aims to build an AI ecosystem to differentiate itself and give back time to its employees to help customers.

It's all AI, all the time, for Sam's Club.

Execs for the wholesale club unit of Walmart (WMT) told Yahoo Finance that it aims to build an extensive AI ecosystem to differentiate its store experience from its rivals.

One goal: more accurate inventory data. Another goal: give more time to employees to actually help customers as they shop. That's all crucial as the company competes for value conscious consumers with other membership-based retailers like BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and Costco (COST).

How? I recently had the chance, with Sam's Club executives, to get an inside look at how AI and technology is being used at a location in Secaucus, New Jersey. Here are some of the innovations:

Sign up: To get a membership, shoppers start by using an iPad (AAPL) and scan a QR code to add their membership card to the app. That routine once took roughly 20 minutes; it's now down to single digits, said Todd Garner, Sam's VP of retail product management.

Help! Displayed throughout the store, the QR Code, in the picture just below, allows customers to quickly ping an associate on an employee-facing app, called My Club, to come over and help. Garner said response time is ""getting pretty fast"" and customers can give immediate feedback on the exchange with the Sam's associate.

Scan for help, now featured at Walmart's Sam's Club for customers to ask for associate help as oppose to searching around for help. (Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance).

Ask Sam: If customers are curious where an item is, employees can ask an AI digital assistant, ""Ask Sam,"" on their iPhone or Google Android. It rolled out back in 2018 and now features new modifications like Spanish translations. Ashley Hughes, a market manager at Sam's Club in Secaucus told me: ""Ask Sam is pretty close to Siri and I think Siri pretty much knows how to do everything.""

Robo-shop: Chipotle's ""Chippy"" has nothing on Sam's store robot. Sam's fans can expect to see a robot roaming around called Scrubbers. Each club has one, for now, and are nicknamed. ""Roberta"" works the floor at the Secaucus club.

The robot was, in the past, just a robo-janitor. But now each has been retrofitted with an inventory intelligence tower. (""More bang for your buck,"" Garner added.)

Roberta's work day: it runs once a day between 8-10 AM to clean the floors and tell associates if the aisles are dirty. If an item is out of stock, or getting close to being out of stock, it notifies the app tool MyClub/Own Your Inventory (OYI). In a typical day, Roberta and its robot peers take 22 million pictures and automates 35% of inventory management tasks.

Fresh sales tool: Another machine learning part of the app creates data forecasts around fresh food production. Pete Rowe, Sam's Club VP of technology, said all the data from the Scrubbers, plus employee insight, is used to predict, and understand inventory levels—particularly food than can quickly spoil.

The associate input is crucial, said Rowe. The machine does not know, at least not now anyway, that there's a local football tailgate that can up the demand for wings and beers. That said, forecasts for items like the ultra-popular rotisserie chicken can be updated hourly thanks to the new tech.

Buy more: ""Scan & Go,"" which has evolved to ""Scan & Go Fuel"" and ""Scan & Go Cafe,"" allows customers to pay for an entire order on the app, or schedule a mobile pickup at the cafe. The AI model also understands customer shopping preferences. That's why, before paying, you might get a ""Did You Forget?"" prompt to buy bacon along with the eggs you just picked up.

So far, Scan & Go seems like a hit for Sam's: its usage is up 230% since its inception in 2019.

The bottom line: it's an new world at Sam's, and other retailers, and there's no turning back.

Low-priced goods alone—and a lot of them— are no longer enough as Walmart CFO John David Rainey might tell you. ""It's not just around price."" he said on Yahoo Finance LIVE. ""It's also around convenience and that matters irrespective of what your income level is and so things like online pickup and delivery continue to grow in much faster rates than the rest of our business.""

Which is crucial for a company the size of Sam's.

This past quarter, for instance, Sam's produced sales of $20.5 billion, up 4.5%—along with a 6.3% increase in membership income. As of May 9, there are 600 Sam's Club locations in the U.S., per data platform ScrapeHero. That's compared to 589 Costco locations and 247 BJ's Wholesale Clubs.

Meanwhile, year-to-date, shares of Sam's parent company, Walmart, which will host its annual meeting next week, are up 4.2%. (Shares of BJ's are down some 3.8%; Costco, which is set to report Thursday after the bell, are up 6.0%.) The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP)? Down, 0.5%.

How's that Roberta?

With its breathtaking surge Thursday, Nvidia could soon land a spot in the most elite Wall Street club, practically overnight. The chipmaker saw its shares surge 26% on Thursday, bringing its market value to just under the $1 trillion mark at about $950 billion, per FactSet. It was $755 billion at Wednesday's close. Nvidia would become the fifth publicly traded U.S. company to be currently worth $1 trillion. Apple created the club in 2018. Microsoft , Alphabet and Amazon also now hold the distinction.

""Back in late 2021, we began publishing work suggesting Nvidia would become the first semiconductor company with a trillion dollar market cap,"" Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said in a note Thursday. ""While there was some peaks and valleys in the interim years, we believe Nvidia is in a position to achieve that valuation over time."" That time could be as early as Thursday.

All eyes on are on Nvidia after it forecast $11 billion in sales for the second quarter of its fiscal 2024 late Wednesday, citing demand for its graphics processors that power artificial intelligence applications like the ones at Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. That forecast blew away Wall Street and turned the AI hype driving the stock into real results. ""Customers are 'racing' to meet large language models (LLMs) and generative AI based demand across all major modalities,"" Gill added. ""We see nearly all past headwinds behind us, and expect the company is shipping to true, AI-related demand, near-term."" The company's shares were already up 108% for the year ahead of Thursday's session. Nvidia's shocking sales guidance – more than 50% above the $7.15 billion analysts anticipated for the quarter – has catapulted its market cap forward almost overnight.

Shein is about to return to India in a big way,CNN,2023-05-26T09:51:55Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/business/shein-reliance-india-return-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong CNN —

Shein is plotting a major comeback in India, nearly three years after it was booted out of the country.

The fast fashion giant is partnering with the retail arm of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, a Shein spokesperson confirmed Friday. The tie-up with the richest man in the world’s most populous nation comes after Shein was banned by the Indian government in 2020 in a sweeping crackdown on Chinese companies.

Little details were made public on Friday. But in recent days, the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported that the two companies had struck a licensing deal that was subsequently approved by the government, allowing Shein to revive its presence in India.

According to the FT, which cited unidentified sources, the partnership will give Shein a share of profits from future sales through Reliance, while Ambani’s empire will help Shein ramp up its manufacturing in India for export markets.

“We can confirm Shein’s partnership with Reliance Retail and have no additional comment at this time,” a Shein spokesperson said. Reliance and India’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shein, an online retailer that competes with Zara and H&M (HNNMY), was banished from India in 2020 as the government banned dozens of Chinese apps in the wake of deadly border clashes that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.

At the time, Shein was headquartered in China. The company later moved to Singapore.

Shein crept back into the Indian market in 2021 through Amazon (AMZN), which included it as a seller for the Prime Day festival. The brand is still listed on the e-commerce giant’s Indian platform, where a small selection of apparel remains available.

A powerful partner

Its new partnership with Reliance Retail, which bills itself as the country’s largest retailer, could be a game-changer. Reliance has expanded aggressively in recent years, bringing in international brands such as 7-Eleven, Burberry, Muji and Pret-A-Manger.

One of the company’s malls also recently welcomed a prominent new anchor tenant: Apple (AAPL), which opened its first physical stores in India last month.

By teaming up with Shein, a seller of trendy goods that enjoys a cult following around the world, Reliance will be able to cater to younger consumers at lower price points.

That’s critical because many of the customers shopping online for the first time in India are young adults from “smaller cities,” according to Bain.

“They primarily purchase fashion as the first category online, and they typically start buying at entry price points,” the consultancy said in a report last year.

Shein, meanwhile, can use the partnership to tap into the world’s third largest e-commerce market, worth an estimated $50 billion in 2022. Fashion is a huge part of that, serving as one of the top drivers of growth, according to Bain.

Shein will also get to further diversify its sourcing, which has come under scrutiny from US lawmakers who have raised questions over whether the company is using forced labor in China.

This month, a bipartisan group of US legislators asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to require Shein to certify that none of its products made in China involve the use of Uyghur forced labor. Washington has banned all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang over such concerns.

Shein has said it doesn’t have any suppliers in the Xinjiang region, and it has zero tolerance for forced labor.

Wednesday Premarket Newsmakers: Why Oil Prices Are Rising Again,24/7 Wall St.,2023-05-24T11:48:46Z,https://247wallst.com/investing/2023/05/24/wednesday-premarket-newsmakers-why-oil-prices-are-rising-again/,"Wednesday Premarket Newsmakers: Why Oil Prices Are Rising Again

Premarket action on Wednesday had the three major U.S. indexes trading lower. The Dow Jones industrials were down 0.24%, the S&P 500 down 0.22% and the Nasdaq 0.13% lower.

Tuesday’s big story was the afternoon collapse of all three major indexes as it became clear that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden were getting nowhere in their negotiations to raise the federal debt limit. Stocks sank, bonds drifted downward and cryptocurrency took the biggest dip of all. Gold slipped by a fraction, and tech megacaps, the new safe haven, could not avoid the sell-off.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell by more than 1.6%, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) dropped more than 1.8% and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) closed down about 1.5%. Wednesday’s premarket session was on track to continue the decline. That leaves energy, and that is worth a look Wednesday morning as we wait for the weekly report on U.S. petroleum inventories.

Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) added nearly 3% on Tuesday after the stock was upgraded to Buy with a price target of $189 by HSBC. The Dow component is unlikely to see big share price gains, but its announced $7.6 billion acquisition of PDC Energy adds assets in both the Denver-Julesburg and Permian Basins to Chevron’s holdings and, more important, PDC’s solid free cash flow (about $1 billion annualized) should mean more returns for shareholders. Chevron is paying no cash in the all-stock deal and is acquiring proved reserves of oil and gas at a price of around $7 per barrel of oil equivalent.

The acquisition is not so much based on increasing production now as it is being among the last companies standing as the world makes the switch to electric vehicles (EVs). Internal combustion engines will remain a significant, but ever-declining, component of world transportation for decades. The Saudis and other Middle East oil producers will be there, and the world’s oil supermajors will be there too. Protests, like the one at Shell’s annual meeting earlier this week, are sure to increase, but the position of energy in the world economy will not change, and the role of oil in that position will change slowly.

After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude oil inventories declined by 6.7 million barrels last week. Analysts were expecting an addition of 525,000 barrels. Crude production remained flat at 12.2 million barrels a day, up by 300,000 year over year, but still 900,000 barrels below the all-time high set in March 2020. Gasoline inventories dropped by about 6.4 million barrels last week, and distillates (diesel fuel, heating oil) fell by 1.8 million barrels.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude added about 1.1% on Tuesday and traded up another 1.6% early Wednesday. Brent crude made similar moves higher. Brent’s per-barrel price is about $4 higher than WTI’s."

S&P 500 Back in the Range – For Now,ValueWalk,2023-05-25T14:56:57Z,https://www.valuewalk.com/sp-500-back-in-the-range-for-now/,"S&P 500 tumbled right through my 4,154 support, reaching all the way to another key milestone of 4,115. Heavy selling across the board, and my key metrics of XLF, XRT, XLI, XLB and IWM stumbled sufficiently just as tech did.

I‘m though looking for tech to not continue easily lower here, HYG and VIX indicate. The former by printing a lower knot before S&P 500 woke up, the latter by VIX being unable to hold 20.50.

Respite in selling is ahead, and ES taking on 4,165 is quite likely in order to close the preceding gap, even without being powered by debt ceiling resolution. The Fitch warning isn‘t enough at the moment, and a deal at the very last minute remains most likely, as the costs of not reaching it are prohibitively high.

If 4,154 resistance doesn‘t hold, 4,165 comes next, and that would hold without 4,177 jeopardized. It‘s too early though for the bears to reassume initiative even if my late in the day call to close ideally below 4,136, materialized. The bears need to regroup here, and get ready for tomorrow‘s core PCE surprise of inflation remaining quite sticky actually.

On one hand, 4,115 followed by 4,078 has to wait still – on the other hand, overcoming 4,225 seems unlikely at the moment, and would signify invalidation of the range breakout. Too early to call beyond today, but the steepness of this correction points to trouble overcoming 4,177 let alone 4,188.

Dr copper was simply right in foretelling a down day yesterday. The many bearish medium-term signs described in latest extensive analyses, are raising their heads.

Aftermarket didn‘t bring any retracement attempt to speak of – instead, sellers retook initiative, and 4,154 turned into resistance. Also real assets confirm this is still a risk-off environment as illustrated by TLT jump higher.

Last but not least, UK inflation data isn‘t an isolated occurence of persistent core figures – US stocks still have to tackle the Fed tightening with lengthy pause vs. easing disconnect, onset of a genuine recession in Q3, LEIs declining for 13 months in a row, shrinking M2, deposits outflow hampering commercial lending, approaching real estate downward path continuation while unemployment claims pick up and Treasury starts issuing fresh debt to replenish TGA. Hardly a bullish cocktail.

Don‘t forget NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings and the highly likely disappointment not living up to the AI hype and chase.

Quoting from yesterday‘s long analysis:

(…) Big Tech is ignoring the glaring disconnect to TLT – these two usually go hand in hand, but GOOGL, MSFT and AAPL with NVDA are still holding up. Talking the last two, there is some short-term technical vulnerability (as in suspect series of latest daily candles) showing up, and I wonder how much more nosebleed for NVDA can come following its earnings tomorrow after the close.

Today is shaping up on a risk-off note, reflecting the poor European manufacturing data that has already pushed many real assets towards my corrective targets. Meanwhile, the long-dated Treasuries outlook is going to change in the following weeks – the run higher will be though more muted than otherwise would have been thanks to the Fed no longer being the buyer, and Treasury General Account replenisment needs following debt ceiling resolution, which would work to suck some liquidity off the market place.

Recession is to start in Q3, and the consumer is getting increasingly into hot water. With household debt over $17T, credit card debt not really retreating (revolving credit up 17% in Mar annualized), the stress is showing in XRT and recent earnings calls from WMT, TGT… leaving AMZN not immune either, methinks.

Don‘t forget that the LEIs I mention so often, have been declining for 13 months in a row, and show no sign of turning. Fed isn‘t happy about the GDP, real estate or job market status as relates its larger inflation ight. Stock market sellers are to retake initiative once this rally runs its course.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq Outlook

4,154 is now resistance, ideally to hold on the closing basis. Dip buying is though to emerge first – bulls aren‘t going to give up without any intraday fight, even on no debt ceiling positive news. 4,136 breach followed by 4,115 are the key objectives, reaching which would take a while, and perhaps also Friday‘s core PCE coming in at least 0.3%. More banking sector, industrials, materials, retail and smallcaps weakness is essential.

Gold repelled the immediate danger of $1,930 and so did silver regarding $23.15. Next weeks would show whether these come into jeopardy again, or not – this week‘s lows are in.

Bitcoin tops blue-chip stocks in 10-year gains,Finbold.com,2023-05-26T11:43:46Z,https://finbold.com/bitcoin-tops-blue-chip-stocks-in-10-year-gains/,"To this day, the emergence and meteoric rise of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to captivate the world of investing and finance, standing as one of the most unprecedented events in recent history.

However, many are not entirely aware of how extraordinary Bitcoin’s price growth actually was, considering that the cryptocurrency was launched just 14 years ago. So let’s put it into numbers.

On Friday, May 26, prominent investor and market strategist Charlie Bilello posted a tweet, showing Bitcoin’s price gains over the last 10 years, compared to price increases recorded by some of the world’s biggest and most blue-chip stocks, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), among others.

The tweet shows that Bitcoin topped that list by some distance, raking in price gains of a whopping 19,968%, followed by Nvidia with 11,145%.

The gap gets even wider as the list progresses, with AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Apple stocks rising 2,896%, 2,884%, and 2,884% during that period, respectively. The likes of Microsoft, Facebook (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) saw their share price soar by 1,047%, 908%, and 459%, respectively.

BTC should be even higher right now, analysts say

Meanwhile, the price of gold – the safe-haven asset that’s considered a store of value and hedge against inflation, climbed just 34% in the past 10 years.

Earlier this week, JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note to clients that gold’s current price suggests that Bitcoin should be trading significantly higher, citing views by some investors that the two assets are interchangeable.

More specifically, BTC’s price should be somewhere around $45,000, which is roughly 70% higher than the cryptocurrency’s present price level of $26,452, the bank’s analysts said in a note published on May 24."
Is the Big Move Real? Or Just a Quick AI-Generated Rally?,Stockcharts.com,2023-05-26T19:44:24Z,https://stockcharts.com/articles/chartwatchers/2023/05/is-the-big-move-real-or-just-a-3.html,"When the stocks of large-cap companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA), keep moving higher and higher in an uncertain economic environment, it can be a cause for concern. Maybe investors have forgotten about these uncertainties surrounding the financial market—inflation is still around, credit conditions are likely to tighten in light of bank struggles, and the debt ceiling has still not been solved. The PCE data released on Friday morning shows that inflation is still a worry. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a higher probability of a 25 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting.

So in the midst of these uncertainties, why is there a massive buying surge in a handful of big tech companies? Blame AI.

FOMO on the AI Rally

A handful of stocks are riding higher on the AI buzz. Here's what's interesting: if you look at the entire S&P 500 index, its performance isn't in sync with the performance of these top five stocks—AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, and NVDA. These five stocks are trading above their 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages. But if you look at the percent of S&P 500 stocks trading above their 200-day moving average ($SPXA200R), it's below the 50% level (see chart below). The chart in the bottom panel is the $SPX, which is trending higher. So there's a divergence between the two.

CHART 1: PERCENTAGE OF S&P 500 STOCKS TRADING ABOVE THEIR 200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE. Even though the S&P index is trending higher, the number of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average is still less than 50%. Chart source: StockCharts.com (click chart for live version). For educational purposes only.

And if you compare the performance of $SPX with the S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index ($SPXEW), the two were pretty correlated until March 2023, when $SPX experienced greater moves (see chart below). Then, from early May, $SPXEW moved lower while $SPX moved higher. The divergence between the two shows that the heavily weighted stocks in the S&P 500 are carrying the index higher.

CHART 2: S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHTED INDEX VS. S&P 500 INDEX. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index equally weights all the stocks in the index. Notice the divergence between the $SPXEW and $SPX in the last few months.Chart source: StockCharts.com (click on chart for live version). For educational purposes only.

To see how one stock impacts the S&P 500 index, look at how NVDA stock surged after its earnings announcement. The stock made headlines—its market cap almost reached $1 trillion after its earnings boost.

NVDA has had a StockCharts Technical Ranking (SCTR) above 70 since January 2023. And its relative strength against the S&P 500 index ($SPX) spiked along with the stock price after knocking earnings out of the ballpark (see chart below).

CHART 3: IS THE AI RALLY REAL? NVDA is a large AI player with a massive influence in the market. It's spreading its AI love to other big tech stocks.Chart source: StockCharts.com (click chart for live version). For educational purposes only.

When equities keep rising quickly, there's always the fear that prices may fall back to reasonable values. A big question among investors is, ""Is there an AI bubble brewing, or is this rally real?"" There's a chance that the stock prices of some of the larger, more AI-centric companies could pull back, but, if AI catches on, what about some of the laggards who could also gain from the AI wave?

Most small-cap indexes have some catching up to do to come close to the returns from the Tech sector. If AI does take off as forecasted, then there's a possibility that several companies that will have to adopt AI into their operations could also benefit from the AI surge. This includes many semiconductor companies that have yet to have a stronger hold in the AI department.

Final Thoughts

So if you missed out on the AI rally in the large-cap AI-centric stocks, give it some time. Things could get extremely competitive as more players enter the field, more partnerships are established, and AI broadens its reach across different industries.

The AI excitement makes it look like the market has forgotten about the debt ceiling, inflation, and possible interest rate hikes. That's not to say you shouldn't take advantage of trading opportunities. You should, as long as you do so without losing sight of the big picture. Monitor the fundamentals, market internals, and price action among the market laggards.

Appleは以前からiPhoneのロック画面のカスタマイズやロック後も画面を常時表示する機能に取り組んでおり、2022年9月にリリースされたiOS 16では、ロック画面のカスタマイズ性が向上したほか、ロックした後も画面に時計やウィジェットを表示させ続ける「常時表示ディスプレイ」が搭載されました。

画面をロックしたあとも時計やウィジェットが表示され続けるiPhoneの「常時表示ディスプレイ」はこんな感じ - GIGAZINE

そしてBloombergは現地時間の5月24日、「Appleはカレンダーの予定、天気、通知などの情報をスマートホームディスプレイのスタイルで表示するiPhone用の新しいインターフェースを、iOS 17ソフトウェアアップデートに含まれる新機能の一部として計画しています」と報告しました。

新しいインターフェースはiPhoneがロックされて水平に配置されている場合に表示され、プロジェクトに精通している人物によると、コンセプトは「机やナイトスタンドで横向きに置かれたiPhoneをより便利にすること」だそうです。Bloombergは、「この動きは、ソフトウェアのより広い範囲にライブ情報を埋め込むAppleの広範な推進力の一環であり、このアプローチにはApple Watchの新しいインターフェースも含まれます」と述べています。

新たなインターフェースは2019年にAndroidで登場した「アンビエントモード」に似ているとBloombergは指摘しており、AmazonやGoogleはタブレットやスマートホームデバイスで似たようなモードを提供していると述べています。匿名を条件にBloombergの取材に応じた人物によると、iPhoneの新しいインターフェースは文字の視認性を上げるために、暗い背景に明るいテキストを使用しているとのこと。

Appleは現地時間の2023年6月5日に開催予定の年次開発者会議「WWDC 2023」でiOS 17について発表し、2023年後半に消費者へリリースする予定です。BloombergはAppleにコメントを求めましたが、広報担当者はiOS 17の計画についてコメントすることを拒否したとのことです。

Bloombergは、AppleはiPhoneだけでなくiPadでも新しい水平インターフェースに取り組んでいるものの、変更がiPadに加えられるのはiPhoneよりも遅くなるだろうとの見通しを示しています。また、Appleは壁やスタンドに磁気で取り付けられる低コストのタブレットなど、デバイスをスマートホームディスプレイに変える他の方法についても模索しているとのこと。

実際にiPhoneの新たなインターフェースがどのような見た目になるのかは不透明ですが、数年前に「iPhoneのナイトスタンドモードはこのようになるのではないか」と予想した画像が作られており、これに類似した見た目になる可能性もあります。

Curious how they’ll pitch this. You’re gonna want some sort of stand for it. Guessing they’re working with Belkin on new stands or even on their own vertical MagSafe stand?

また、GoogleのPixel Standを使用した時のような見た目になる可能性も指摘されています。

他にもiOS 17では、iPhoneのウォレットアプリの変更や位置情報サービスの強化、メモ機能やソーシャル要素を追加したジャーナリングアプリ、視力の弱い人々のサポートやメンタルヘルスケアに焦点を当てたヘルスアプリの変更、画面共有機能のアップグレードなども計画されています。

Here’s my big problem with the Woolworths share price,Motley Fool Australia,2023-05-26T03:48:33Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2023/05/26/heres-my-big-problem-with-the-woolworths-share-price/,"I like Woolworths, but I have a major problem with its share price.

The Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW) share price has had a very pleasing year so far in 2023. Since January, Woolworths shares have risen from just over $33 to the $38.04 that we see today. That’s a gain worth a healthy 15%, which far outstrips the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO)’s gain of 2.9% over the same period.

However, I have a confession. I have a major problem with the Woolworths share price right now.

Don’t get me wrong, I think Woolworths is one of the best companies in Australia. It is completely dominant in its grocery and supermarket sector, thanks to a strong brand and high consumer loyalty. It is a tightly run company that is comfortably profitable. It is also an inherently defensive business thanks to its consumer staples nature.

But I don’t think Woolworths is a good investment today. The problem I have with the Woolworths share price comes down to valuation.

Right now, the Woolworths share price has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.86.

That means investors are being asked to pay $27.86 for every $1 of earnings that Woolworths generates.

The Woolworths share price is just too expensive

That, in my view, is expensive. To illustrate, right now, Woolies’ arch-rival Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COL) has a P/E ratio of 21.74.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) is the most expensive ASX 200 bank share, but even it currently has a P/E ratio of 17.3.

In fact, Woolworths shares have pretty much the same price-to-earnings ratio as Google-owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) right now. Even Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is only a little higher at 29.4.

When I think of companies like Apple or Alphabet, I can see a clear path for these shares to grow meaningfully over the next decade, given their global dominance.

But is Woolworths really on that kind of scale? It’s arguable that Woolworths is at complete market saturation here in Australia. Sure, it might eke out some growth over the next few years thanks to cost savings, productivity increases and population growth.

But just take a look at the company’s net income over the past five years:

Source: TradingView, Woolworths net income

Doesn’t look like breakneck growth to me. And certainly not enough to justify a P/E ratio in the high 20s, in my view.

Don’t get me wrong, Woolworths is a quality business that spins off billions in profits every year. But I believe that the markets are pricing Woolworth far too high today to make it a good investment going forward.

If the company was trading at a valuation more similar to that of Coels, even at a slight premium, it would be far more compelling. But as it stands today, I don’t see anything I like in Woolworths’ P/E ratio of 27.86 or its dividend yield of 2.6%."
Buying an S&P 500 ETF to diversify your ASX investments?

Buying an S&P 500 ETF to diversify your ASX investments? You’ll want to know this

Buying exchange traded funds (ETFs) can be a simple way to diversify your ASX portfolio. But those tracking Wall Street’s S&P 500 Index (SP: .INX) might not provide the same level of risk protection as other ETFs.

The S&P 500 was launched in 1957 and currently houses around 500 large-cap US stocks.

However, as it now stands, the index is notably concentrated, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer for wealth management Lisa Shalett warns. Here’s where she suggests investors put their money when working to diversify their portfolios instead.

ASX ETFs can boast built-in diversification

Portfolio diversification is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce the risks born from investing. It essentially means not putting all your eggs in one basket.

By spreading your wealth across numerous stocks operating in different sectors, or listed on different markets, one might be better prepared in the case of a single company, or sector, downturn.

On the other hand, ETFs are essentially a parcel of various stocks, housed in a fund that trades like a share.

ETFs like iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (ASX: SPY) have built parcels of stocks with the aim of mirroring the S&P 500.

So, with the S&P 500 covering around 80% of the US stock market’s available market capitalisation, why wouldn’t an ETF tracking it be a good diversification buy for ASX investors?

S&P 500 doesn’t offer worthwhile diversification: Expert

Well, the S&P 500 might not be as diversified as it might seem, Shalett recently wrote for Morgan Stanley.

That’s because of the burgeoning valuations of the US’s biggest tech stocks.

Investors have flocked to companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). They’re considered defensive buys amid current economic uncertainty, the expert noted.

The below chart shows how the three stocks have risen over the last four months. The vertical axis represents the percentage gained:

The S&P 500 we know and love is weighted by valuation. That means massive growth from the index’s 10 largest companies sees them make up almost 35% of its market cap. Shalett wrote:

This means that money deployed into the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 is increasingly a wager on the health of just a few companies—with the fundamentals of the other 490 carrying less weight.

Not to mention, the ten giants are said to have an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28. Meanwhile, the trio mentioned above boast a mind-blowing P/E of 66. That’s compared to the index’s average of around 19.

That means the company’s earnings are expected to stay high – a factor that’s said to be dependent on low interest rates. Thus, if rates stay high for longer than anticipated, it could prove dire for the stocks.

If not the S&P 500, then what?

So, where does Shalett think investors looking to diversify put their hard-earned money?

She sees opportunities in small-cap stocks, value shares, cyclical companies, and emerging markets."
GraniteShares Announces Change in ETF Lineup,GlobeNewswire,2023-05-26T20:30:00Z,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/26/2677378/0/en/GraniteShares-Announces-Change-in-ETF-Lineup.html,"NEW YORK, May 26, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares announced today that it will close and liquidate the following ETF:

FUND RISKS

You could lose money by investing in the Funds. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program. The investment programs of the Funds are speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. Investments in the Funds are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile, and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks.

A liquid secondary market may not exist for commodity-linked derivative instruments. This may make them difficult for certain Funds to sell them at an acceptable price.

Because the Funds may effect redemptions principally for cash, rather than in-kind distributions, an investment in a Fund’s shares may be less tax efficient than investments in shares of conventional ETFs, and there may be a substantial difference in the after-tax rate of return between a Fund and conventional ETFs.

A Fund may engage in frequent trading of derivatives. Active and frequent trading may lead to the realization and distribution to shareholders of higher short-term capital gains, which would increase their tax liability. Frequent trading also increases transaction costs, such as commissions, which could detract from the Fund’s performance."

Shares of American Express (AXP) rose 4% after a Morgan Stanley analyst said the stock could rise 20% as a recent sell-off had it at an ""attractive"" entry point.

Microsoft (MSFT) moved up 2.1% after Oppenheimer reiterated its outperform rating on the software giant. Salesforce (CRM) rose 2.6%, while IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) both ticked up 1.7%. Apple (AAPL) moved higher by 1.4%.

Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rose 0.8% after Piper Sandler initiated coverage on the stock with an overweight rating. It set a $580 price target, 21% above its current share price.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) spent most of the day in the red but rallied to close up 0.1% after the company announced plans to lay off 10% of its corporate staff.

Healthcare and energy were the only sectors to end the day down. Merck & Co. (MRK) was the Dow's worst performer, falling 1.1%. Amgen (AMGN) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) fell 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.



Despite its eleventh-hour rally, the Dow couldn’t make up for drops earlier in the week when debt-ceiling negotiations stalled. The index ended the week down about 1%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500, however, got a boost from Big Tech and finished the week in the green, rising 2.5% and 0.4%, respectively."
Nvidia Nears $1 Trillion In Market Capitalization,Investopedia,2023-05-25T14:42:41Z,https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-usd1-trillion-market-capitalization-7504037,"Nvidia (NVDA)'s market capitalization briefly surpassed $950 billion in early trading Thursday, pushing it to a new record and making it more valuable than the next five biggest U.S. chipmakers combined.

The chipmaker is now worth more than the total of competitors Broadcom (AVGO), AMD (AMD), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) put together. It is also just shy of the coveted $1 trillion valuation, a feat only five U.S. companies—tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)—have been able to attain thus far.

Better-than-expected earnings sent Nvidia's shares soaring more than 20% in after-hours trading and its market cap rose nearly $200 billion in a single session.

Nvidia shares are up a stunning 130% year-to-date, having already more than doubled in 2023 before today’s gain. They’ve far outperformed the broader information technology sector, which is up 25% over the same period.

Better ASX ETF to buy: Vanguard VGS or VAS?,Motley Fool Australia,2023-05-25T03:53:36Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2023/05/25/better-asx-etf-to-buy-vanguard-vgs-or-vas/,"VGS or VAS: Which ETF comes out on top for ASX investors?

You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More

The Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) and the Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF (ASX: VGS) are two of the most popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the ASX. Both are index funds, but that’s where the similarities end.

So today, let’s compare these two popular ETFs, and what they can offer ASX investors going forward. Can we decide which is the best ASX ETF?

Although both of these ETFs are popular with ASX investors, it’s the Vanguard Australian Shares ETF that is by far the most dominant. Indeed, it is the top ETF in Australia, with more than $12 billion in assets under management. That contrasts with the Vanguard International Shares ETF with just under $5.8 billion.

This probably reflects ASX investors’ bias towards the local share market.

What sets these two popular ASX ETFs apart?

The VAS ETF is an ASX-only fund, tracking the largest 300 shares listed on the Australian stock exchange. The VGS ETF, on the other hand, invests in no ASX shares. Instead, it holds a massive basket of more than 1,500 individual shares that hail from more than 20 advanced economies around the world. These include Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Israel, Norway, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

But by far the most dominant country in this ETF’s portfolio is the United States. US shares make up a whopping 69.1% of VGS’s weighted share portfolio.

Here are the Vanguard Australian Shares ETF’s top ten holdings, as of 30 April:

See how this contrasts with the Vanguard International Shares ETF’s top ten:

All ten of these shares are American companies. In fact, the first non-US share you will come across in VGS’s portfolio is Swiss food giant Nestle in 15th spot.

Best ASX ETFs: VGS or VAS?

Here are some more comparisons between these two ETFs:

VAS VGS Annual fee 0.1% per annum 0.18% per annum Number of individual portfolio holdings 303 1,471 Dividend yield (at time of writing) 5.54% 1.38% Franking credits? Yes No Dividend distribution frequency Quarterly Quarterly 3 most dominant sectors Financials (27.2%),



Materials (24.2%),



Health Care (10.3%)

Information Technology (20.4%),



Financials (14.8%),



Health Care (13.7%) Countries represented 1 22 Data: Vanguard, Chart: Author’s Own

So you can see just how much these two ETFs differ in terms of scope and scale.

But let’s get to the meat and potatoes, and compare the performances of these two funds:

VAS VGS 1-year performance (to 30 April) 2.09% 11.24% 3-year performance average 14% 12.78% 5-year performance average 8.22% 11.2% Data: Vanguard, Chart: Author’s Own

Thus, it’s clear that the Vanguard International Shares ETF has convincingly outperformed the Australian Shares ETF over one and five years. VAS does come out on top over three years though, although this might be a little distorted thanks to the COVID crash of 2020.

Does that better long-term performance make VGS the best ETF automatically? Well, not necessarily. These two ETFs represent different asset classes. Sure, the past five years have been far kinder to international shares than ASX shares. But this probably comes down to a few factors.

The US tech stocks that dominate VGS’s portfolio have had spectacular runs over the past five years, whereas our big four banks have been a little more muted. The Aussie dollar has also been dropping in value over the past five years fairly consistently, so this also boosts the performance of international shares against ASX shares when measured in our currency.

If the dollar spends the next five years appreciating against the greenback, and our local share market delivers a solid performance, then we could well see VAS beat out VGS going forward.

Not quite apples-to-apples

VAS is certainly the winner when it comes to providing income though. Its current yield of 5.54% looks laughably good against VGS’s more miserly 1.38%. VAS’s dividend distributions also come with franking credits, whose significant benefits don’t show up in these performance figures. Its fee is also a lot cheaper at 0.1% per annum, against VGS’s 0.18%.

But then again, the VGS ETF is far better diversified, with its largest sector coming in with a weighting of 20.4%, against VAS’s financials at 27.2%.

And there’s no denying that the calibre of VGS’s top holdings, the likes of Apple and Amazon, generate a lot of sales over our top companies like CBA and BHP.

So, yes, the Vanguard International Shares ETF has been the better fund in recent history in terms of raw, long-term performance. But that doesn’t make it the best investment forevermore. Perhaps the wisest investors will get the best of both worlds by building a portfolio that houses both Australian and international shares."
Dow Jones Today: Index Dips Despite AI Wave,Investopedia,2023-05-25T21:34:03Z,https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-may-25-2023-7504381,"Key Takeaways Microsoft, Cisco, and IBM among biggest gainers as investors look for AI stocks.

Intel, a PC chipmaker living in an AI world, was the Dow's worst performer.

Boeing moves higher as its jet production levels move closer to yearly goals.



The value-oriented Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.1%, or about 35 points, as investors brushed off debt-ceiling gridlock and piled into tech stocks.

Stocks were lifted by a blockbuster earnings report from Nvidia, which soared 25%, nearly becoming one of only a handful of companies to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization. The chipmaker helped carry the Nasdaq higher by 1.7%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.9%.

After sliding as much as 0.6% in the morning, the Dow rallied after reports that lawmakers were making progress on debt ceiling negotiations.

Microsoft (MSFT) was the Dow’s best performer, rising 3.9% on AI hype. The company also moved to appeal U.K. regulators' decision to block its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

Other tech stocks followed, with Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM) rising 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. Apple (AAPL) and Salesforce (CRM) also moved higher.

Boeing (BA) gained 0.8% after it announced it had resolved a manufacturing glitch with its 737 Max jet and was on track to meet its delivery goals of 400-450 jets this year.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) told 1,000 First Republic staffers, the troubled bank it took over earlier this month, that they would lose their jobs. The cuts reflect about 15% of the bank’s workforce. Shares of JPMorgan moved higher by 0.2%.

Intel (INTC) was the Dow's worst performer, falling 5.5% after Nvidia’s powerhouse earnings cast light on the chasm forming between chipmakers. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are vital in AI computing, while demand for Intel’s traditional central processing units (CPUs) has stalled.

Walt Disney (DIS) shares fell 0.9% after a Wall Street Journal report detailed its ongoing fight with Comcast (CMCSA), with which it co-owns Hulu, as the two attempt to end their joint ownership of the streaming service."
Nvidia's jaw-dropping beat and raise sends its share price to a record high,CNBC,2023-05-24T23:44:09Z,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/nvidias-jaw-dropping-beat-and-raise-sends-the-stock-to-record-high.html,"Nvidia 's (NVDA) fiscal year 2024 first-quarter earnings Wednesday far outpaced Wall Street's expectations. But as strong as the results were, the chipmaker's guidance for its current quarter was even more robust, driving shares to a new all-time high in afterhours trading. Revenue for the three months ended April 30 fell 13% year-over year, to $7.19 billion, but still came in well ahead of analysts' forecasts of $6.52 billion, according to the consensus estimate from Refinitiv. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) dropped 20% on an annual basis, to $1.09, though still surpassed predictions for 92 cents per share, Refinitiv data showed. Adjusted gross margin of 66.8% edged out the 66.5% estimate from analysts, according to FactSet. Shares of the semiconductor firm surged nearly 30% in post-market trading Wednesday, to around $381 apiece. The semiconductor firm's market capitalization gained $220 billion in the extended-hours session, bringing it to around $975 billion. That compares with a current market capitalization of $174 billion for competitor and fellow Club name Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Bottom line There is no overstating just how impressive this release was. With the stock up more than 100% year-to-date coming into the print, the bar was high. But the reported results easily exceeded even the most bullish expectations. The forward guidance, though — helped by soaring demand for Nvidia's data center chips, which power generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models — was nothing short of jaw-dropping. Nvidia's technology has become critical to the AI ecosystem, helping to power large language models like OpenAI's viral ChatGPT. Moreover, the phenomenal sales guidance for the current quarter – one of the strongest versus expectations that we've ever seen – is going to have an even greater impact on the bottom line, given management's gross margin guide was materially above Wall Street models ahead of the earnings release. ""We're going through that moment right now as we speak, while the world's data center [capital expenditure] budget is limited. At the same time, we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers, so I think you're seeing the beginning of ... call it a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on Nvidia's post-earnings conference call. He added: ""You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of the data center from traditional computing to accelerated computing, with smart mix, smart switches, of course [graphics processing units, or GPUs] and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI."" Ultimately, today's release reinforces our conviction that Nvidia is in rarefied territory, deserving of being the second name Jim Cramer has ever designated as 'own it, don't trade' – Apple (AAPL), of course, being the first. Our rating and price target, which we expect to move higher, are under review. Guidance Looking ahead to Nvidia's fiscal 2024 second quarter, management forecasted better-than-expected sales, adjusted gross margin and capital expenditures on a non-GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, basis. Additionally, management expects operating expenses of $1.90 billion, other income of approximately $90 million, and a tax rate of 14% (plus or minus 1%). Though management does not provide a forecast for EPS, analysts at Truist Wednesday noted that the implied earnings guidance is in the range of $1.94 to $2.14 per share. At the $2.04-per-share midpoint, that's nearly double the $1.06 per share the Street was expecting. Today's results, along with the outlook, demonstrate that Nvidia, often knocked for its high valuation, is more often than not far cheaper than it seems on initial estimates. Coming into the print, the Street was modeling full-year adjusted EPS to be $4.59 per share. Adding up today's $1.09 EPS result with the $2.04 mid-point estimate of the implied guidance for the current quarter, it becomes clear that Nvidia is on pace to reach EPS of $3.13 in the first half of its fiscal year alone. Combined with the company's belief that generative AI has ""extended Nvidia's data center visibility out a few quarters"" with ""substantially higher supply for the second half of the year,"" Wall Street's valuations appear far to low. And we expect many revisions higher once analysts have updated their models. Quarterly commentary Data center sales in the reported quarter represented a new record for the company, driven by increased demand for generative AI and large language models. Gaming demand was impacted by the ongoing effort to normalize channel inventories, as well as lower demand resulting from the macroeconomic slowdown. On a sequential basis, however, sales were higher thanks to the new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. Revenue at the professional visualization unit was also down on annual basis, a result of efforts to normalize channel inventory levels. However, it was up sequentially on improved demand for desktop and mobile workstation GPUs. Automotive sales, despite coming in below analysts' expectations, demonstrated superb growth, boosted by sales of Nvidia's self-driving platforms and AI cockpit solutions. Nvidia on Wednesday said its automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now stands at $14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, which should give ""visibility into continued growth over the coming years."" Capital Allocation In the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, Nvidia returned $99 million to shareholders via dividends. As of the end of that quarter, there was $7.23 billion remaining under the company's current share-buyback authorization, which runs through December 2023.

Dividends from big listed companies hit record $326.7 billion in first quarter.,MarketWatch,2023-05-24T06:56:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dividends-from-big-listed-companies-hit-record-326-7-billion-in-first-quarter-8d9a0a2,"Dividends paid out by the world’s biggest public companies jumped 12% to a record $326.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, with a large chunk of the increase delivered by bumper distributions from U.S. stocks.

However, a large proportion of the headline surge in payouts came from special dividends, leaving underlying growth at just 3%, according to research from Janus Henderson, the London-based asset manager.

Source: Janus Henderson

“The strong dividend growth we have seen in Q1 [first quarter] 2023 is all the more impressive considering the challenges the global economy faced in 2022, such as high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflict and continuing COVID lockdowns,” said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.

“Profits were nonetheless strong last year, and this has supported further dividend growth,” he added.

Janus Henderson analyzed 1,200 of the world’s largest companies by market value. It found that 95% of those grew their dividends or kept them steady, though within the cohort a sharp decline in mining sector payouts, driven by falling commodity prices, was counteracted by growth from financials and energy.

Source: Janus Henderson

Falling mining dividends will continue to be the biggest drag on overall dividend growth in 2023, said Janus Henderson, though it still sees payouts increasing to $1.64 trillion, up 5.2% on a headline basis it predicted.

One-off special dividends surged to $28.8 billion, the second biggest on record, with Ford F, +6.24% and Volkswagen VOW3, +0.02% accounting for almost a third, meaning headline payouts from the vehicles sector were ten times larger year-on-year as a result. One-off special dividends also made a significant impact in the transport, oil and software sectors, said Janus Henderson.

U.S. payouts, including “exceptionally large one-off special dividends” rose 8.3% to a record $153/4 billion, driven mainly by the real estate, technology and healthcare sectors. Microsoft MSFT, +2.14% and Apple AAPL, +1.41% were in the top ten of dividend payers in the first quarter.

Total dividends in Europe hit $60.3bn, with Denmark, Germany and Switzerland accounting for three quarters of the total paid.

“Combined with the exceptionally large one-off special dividends we have seen in the first quarter, we have upgraded our forecast for 2023, although it is worth reiterating that we expect growth to be markedly slower for the rest of 2023 than over the last two years,” said Lofthouse.

“The world economy is slowing as inflation, higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions increasingly impact demand, and almost all the easy gains from the post-pandemic bounce back have now been made. Happily, dividends are typically less volatile than earnings over time, however,” he concluded."
"Nvidia’s market capitalization gain on Thursday is bigger than all of Disney, Netflix, Boeing or Nike",MarketWatch,2023-05-25T20:45:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-market-capitalization-gain-on-thursday-is-bigger-than-all-of-disney-netflix-boeing-or-nike-1301640,"On Thursday, Nvidia’s stock took an epic jump among the nation’s corporate giants. In one day, the graphics-chip maker total market capitalization added nearly $184 billion – that’s billion with a b. It is one of the biggest one-day market capitalization gains in American corporate history.

Nvidia’s market capitalization was $754.3 billion at the stock market’s close on Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and it traded as high as $973.8 billion intraday on Thursday, closing around $938.1 billion, based on 2.47 billion shares outstanding and shares at $379.80.

To get a sense of the scale, Nvidia’s market capitalization gain on just Thursday was greater than the entire stock market capitalization of some of the biggest and most iconic companies, which operate in industries ranging from banking, entertainment, apparel and software.

Below is a comparison of 10 S&P 500 companies with total market capitalizations that are less than the gain Nvidia has experienced on Thursday.

MarketWatch

Ever heard of Wells Fargo WFC, +0.81% , Morgan Stanley MS, +1.08% , Blackstone Group BX, +2.60% or Goldman Sachs GS, +2.51% ? These are the titan companies of Wall Street. Nvidia’s market cap increase on Thursday was bigger than the whole market capitalization of each of these companies.

Bigger than Mickey Mouse? Yes. Nvidia’s market capitalization jump on Thursday was bigger than the entire market capitalization of Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.17% , Netflix NFLX, +5.54% , Nike NKE, +0.03% , Boeing, UPS UPS, +0.20% , Verizon VZ, +0.52% and Adobe ADBE, +5.95% . If Nvidia’s market capitalization gain on Thursday was its own company, it would be the 55th biggest public company on Earth, according to data from companiesmarketcap.com.

Of course, Nvidia NVDA, +2.54% is one company and its total market cap is now approaching $1 trillion. There are only five companies in the world that sport market capitalizations in excess of $1 trillion — Apple AAPL, +1.41% , Microsoft MSFT, +2.14% , Saudi Aramco, Alphabet (Google) GOOGL, +0.92% and Amazon AMZN, +4.44% . Nvidia will join the club if it ever closes at $404.86. The stock closed at $379.80 on Thursday.

What happened on Thursday? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the company’s other executives said Wednesday evening that AI-driven data-center sales would power record revenue that would reach some $11 billion in the second quarter, compared to the $7.17 billion Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. Last year, Nvidia reported $6.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter.

Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities tech analyst, tweeted that “in 22 years of covering tech stocks and large cap we have NEVER seen a guidance range of this magnitude on a large cap tech name.”

It is a game changer in many ways. According to a MarketWatch analysis of FactSet data, Nvidia now represents about 4.6% of the entire Nasdaq stock market, compared to 3.74% yesterday.

After forecasting record revenue backed by a “killer AI app,” Nvidia helped deliver a powerful performance for the Nasdaq COMP on Thursday. Indeed, thanks to that chip maker and a few other generals — Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, etc.— tech is seemingly unstoppable:

Our call of the day offers valuable insight on tech investing amid AI mania from a pair of seasoned investors.

Inge Heydorn, partner on the GP Bullhound Global Technology Fund and portfolio manager Jenny Hardy, advise choosing companies carefully given high valuations in some parts of tech that could make earnings vulnerable.

“But looking slightly beyond the volatility, tech has the advantage of being driven by many long-term secular themes which will continue to play out despite a weaker macro,” Hardy told MarketWatch in follow-up comments to an interview with the pair last week. GP Bullhound invests in leading global tech companies, with more than $1 billion in assets under management.

“We try to make sure we’re exposed to these areas that will be more resilient. AI is the perfect example of that –- none of Microsoft, Amazon or Google will risk falling behind in the AI race -– they will all keep spending, and that will continue to drive earnings for the semiconductor companies that go into these servers higher,” said Hardy, who has worked in the investment industry since 2011.

“The way that we think about investing around [AI] is in the building blocks, the picks and shovels infrastructure, which for us is really the semiconductor companies that go into the training servers and the inference servers,” she said.

Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM TW:2330, Infineon XE:IFX, Cisco CSCO, NXP NXPI, Microsoft MSFT, ServiceNow NOW and Palo Alto PANW are all in their portfolio. They also like the semiconductor capital equipment industry — AI beneficiaries and tailwinds from increasingly localized supply chains — with companies including KLA KLAC, Lam Research LRCX, ASML ASML and Applied Materials AMAT.

As Hardy points out, “lots of big tech has given us lots of certainty as it relates to AI, lots of certainty as it relates to the amount they are going to spend on AI.”

Enter Nvidia’s results, which Hardy said are proof the “AI spend race has begun…Nvidia’s call featured an impressive roster of companies deploying AI with Nvidia – AT&T, Amgen, ServiceNow – the message was that this technology adoption is widespread and really a new normal.” She said they see benefits spreading across the AI value chain — CPU providers, networking infrastructure players, memory and semicap equipment makers.

Heydorn, who traded technology stocks since 1994 and also runs a hedge fund with Hardy, says there are two big tech trends currently — “AI across the board and power semiconductors driven by EV cars and green energy projects.”

But GP Bullhound steers clear of EV makers like Tesla TSLA, where they see a lot of competition, notably from China. “Ultimately, they will need semiconductors and the semiconductors crucially are able to keep that pricing power in a way that the vehicle companies are not able to do because of the differences in competition,” she said.

Are the tech duo nervous about anything? “The macro economy is clearly the largest risk and further bank or real-estate problems,” said Heydorn, as Hardy adds that they are watching for second-order impacts on tech.

“One example would be enterprise software businesses with high exposure to financial services, which given those latest problems in that sector, might see a re-prioritization of spend away from new software implementations,” she said.

In the near term, Heydorn says investors should watch out for May sales numbers and any AI mentions from Taiwan via TSMC, mobile chip group MediaTek TW:2454 and Apple AAPL supplier Foxxconn TW:2354 that may help with guidance for the second half of the year. “The main numbers in Taiwan will tell us where we are in inventories. They’re going to tell us if the 3-nanonmeters, that’s a new processor that’s going into Apple iPhones, are ready for production,” he said.

": Nvidia short sellers get scorched further, racking up $2.2 billion in paper losses Thursday",MarketWatch,2023-05-26T16:38:24Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-short-sellers-get-scorched-further-racking-up-2-2-billion-in-paper-losses-thursday-aaf12ad1,"It’s been a brutal year for those betting against Nvidia Corp.’s stock, and the pain got worse Thursday.

Short sellers incurred $2.2 billion in mark-to-market losses on their Nvidia NVDA, +2.54% positions in Thursday’s session alone, according to data from S3 Partners, as Nvidia shares ran up 24% in the session on the heels of a staggering outlook.

Nvidia shorts are down an estimated $8 billion so far this year, according to S3 director Matthew Unterman, who told MarketWatch that “unsurprisingly,” Nvidia has been the top loss-making short play on a year-to-date basis—by a wide margin. Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.72% ranks second in driving $5.8 billion in paper losses, while Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.41% ranks third at $5 billion.

Nvidia shares are up 164% so far in 2023. They’re up 23.3% thus far this week and on track to record their best weekly percentage gain since a stretch in November 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

It wasn’t too long ago that Wall Street had concerns about both Nvidia’s data-center business and its gaming business. But shares have shot up 244% from their 52-week low achieved in mid-October, a rally that reflected building optimism about the company’s potential to benefit from the rush to build out artificial-intelligence tools.

That hype translated into real numbers Wednesday when Nvidia gave a massive forecast for $11 billion in quarterly revenue, fueled by heavy demand for AI products.

“Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to Nvidia accelerated computing,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on the company’s earnings call.

The company’s outlook factors in “a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large-language models,” she continued. “This demand has extended our data-center visibility out a few quarters, and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year.”

Nvidia CFO on record-breaking forecast: ‘The inflection point of AI is here’"
MarketWatch: Nvidia barrels toward rare $1 trillion valuation after putting a dollar figure on AI boost,MarketWatch,2023-05-24T22:23:40Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-barrels-toward-rare-1-trillion-valuation-after-putting-a-dollar-figure-on-ai-boost-443b7d0f,"Nvidia Corp. headed toward market-capitalization gains of nearly $200 billion in after-hours trading Wednesday, which could put the chip maker within sight of becoming only the seventh U.S. company to top a valuation of $1 trillion.

Nvidia shares NVDA jumped 25% in the extended session Wednesday, after executives predicted that revenue would exceed the company’s record by more than 30% in the current quarter. The audacious forecast arrived as tech companies look to jump on advances in artificial intelligence that are largely powered by Nvidia’s computing gear.

Nvidia ended Wednesday’s session with a market cap — the total value of all shares in existence — of roughly $754.3 billion, according to FactSet. A 25% increase would add nearly $189 billion to that total, putting the company within striking distance of $1 trillion. Only six U.S. companies have ever attained a $1 trillion market cap: Apple Inc. AAPL and Microsoft Corp. MSFT are currently worth more than $2 trillion apiece; Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN have valuation of more than $1 trillion; and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META and Tesla Inc. TSLA have both touched the $1 trillion plateau previously.

Nvidia’s market cap was ahead of both Meta and Tesla as of Wednesday’s close, with both worth less than $650 billion, showing the potential fleeting nature of such a valuation. Nvidia’s record market cap is $834.4 billion, established on Nov. 29. 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

If Nvidia’s gains hold through Thursday’s trading session, the company could challenge for the largest one-day market-cap gain in history. The biggest currently on record was Amazon’s $191.2 billion increase on Feb. 4, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data, followed closely by a $190.9 billion gain by Apple on Nov. 10, 2022. Nvidia also stands to gain more than rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD is worth in total — AMD ended Wednesday’s session with a market cap of $174.4 billion.

Nvidia is closing in on the rare $1 trillion plateau because of huge gains in its stock this year, as hopes and hype about generative AI have flooded the tech sector. After OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT AI offering, and investor Microsoft quickly integrated the chatbot into many of its services, expectations for the technology have exploded.

Despite the hype, most companies have avoided providing hard figures for revenue gains expected from AI. Nvidia’s fiscal second-quarter forecast — which calls for roughly $11 billion in sales, nearly 33% higher than Nvidia’s previous quarterly record of $8.28 billion — could be seen as the first sign of a wave of fresh spending coursing through the tech sector.

Other companies have indicated that they will be forced to spend to develop their technology before reaping large financial rewards from it. Microsoft, for example, disclosed to investors last month that capital expenditures are increasing as it builds AI capabilities into its Azure cloud-computing platform — spending that is largely going toward Nvidia.

That is a rather typical path for large jumps in tech spending: Companies that make the necessary hardware see gains before the companies that use that gear can develop offerings that take advantage of it. Other gear makers joined Nvidia in the sharp move higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, including AMD, which gained more than 10%; chip maker Marvell Technology Inc. MRVL, which increased more than 5%; and networking specialist Arista Networks Inc. ANET, which added about 5%.

Alphabet and Microsoft stocks both increased around 2% in after-hours trading, and software companies that have made AI a core part of their offerings also saw gains. Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR and C3.ai Inc. AI shares both increased more than 8%, for example."

Dow drags behind Nasdaq by widest margin yet as blue-chip gauge misses out on Nvidia rally,MarketWatch,2023-05-25T21:50:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-drags-behind-nasdaq-by-widest-margin-yet-as-blue-chip-gauge-misses-out-on-nvidia-rally-2d0aeeb,"After outperforming the Nasdaq by the widest margin in two decades last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sunk back into third place in 2023.

And with little exposure to the stock-market craze of the moment — artificial intelligence — some wonder if this underperformance is destined to continue for the foreseeable future.

After Nvidia Corp. delivered its blockbuster earnings on Wednesday evening, the chip-maker’s shares soared an astromonical 24.4% on Thursday, a huge move for a company that’s already one of the largest by market capitalization.

But the Dow missed out, and when the dust had settled, the Nasdaq had outperformed it by the widest margin since February, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Thursday’s session was also the 100th trading day of 2023, which gave way to another depressing factoid about the Dow’s performance.

During the first 100 trading days of the year, the Nasdaq COMP, +2.19% has now outperformed the blue-chip index DJIA, +1.00% by more than 22 percentage points, the widest margin since the Nasdaq’s launch in 1971, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% has also blown past the Dow, beating it by more than 9 percentage points through the first 100 sessions, also its largest outperformance ever.

The Nasdaq is up more than 21% year to date and the Dow is down roughly 1.2%, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 has risen 8.1%.

The Dow’s dragging performance has revived criticisms that the blue-chip gauge is antiquated or no longer representative of the broader U.S. equity market.

One popular criticism of the Dow is that it doesn’t have enough exposure to technology stocks, and now artificial intelligence. Enthusiasm about AI has helped drive the rally in stocks in 2023.

While the Dow’s 30 stocks include both Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.14% and Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.41% , the two tech giants don’t receive quite as heavy as a weighting in the Dow as they do in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

This is part of what makes the Dow seem “old-fashioned,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of the Wealth Alliance, during a phone interview with MarketWatch.

“If you want to talk about artificial intelligence, there’s not a lot of exposure to that in the Dow,” Diton said. “There’s no Nvidia.”

Diton also listed a few other key stocks that are missing from the Dow.

Meta Platforms Inc. META, +3.70% , Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.87% , Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.72% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.44% are also lacking from the Dow, Diton noted, all of which have been major contributors to the S&P 500’s and Nasdaq’s gains this year.

While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are most heavily weighted toward megacap technology names, the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow is UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +0.80% . Why? Because at nearly $480 per share, UNH sports the highest share price in the average, which is price-weighted.

Investors seemed more receptive to the Dow last year, when it emerged as the least-bad option in equity markets.

Back then, talk of de-globalization and soaring energy prices helped limit losses in some cyclical sectors, while driving shares of oil-and-gas companies higher,

But the narrative has shifted in 2023. Recession fears have battered companies that are seen to be more closely linked to sectors like real estate, industrials and energy. Meanwhile, the AI craze has revived interest in tech.

This “new economy vs. old economy” dynamic that has emerged between the Dow and the Nasdaq also contributes to the notion that the Dow now longer offers a broad picture of the U.S. market.

“The Dow is kind of out of step with the times,” said Callie Cox, a U.S. equity strategist at eToro, during a phone interview.

Wall Street analysts had largely expected the Dow would continue to outperform in early 2023 as the Nasdaq Composite logged a fresh closing low on Dec. 28, its lowest end-of-day level since July 2020.

To be sure, the Dow isn’t the only major index that is struggling this year. The Russell 2000 RUT, +1.05% , an index of small-cap stocks, is down 0.4% year to date through Thursday, according to FactSet data.

Some still see value in the Dow since it doesn’t trade at quite as high a premium to the expected profits of its members. The price-to-earnings ratio for the blue-chip average stands at 16.4, compared with 18.3 for the S&P 500 and a whopping 26 for the Nasdaq Composite.

The Dow finished Thursday’s session down 35.27 points, or 0.1%, to 2,764.65. It marked a notable improvement off its lows, where the index was down more than 200 points. The Nasdaq Composite finished the day up 213.93 points, or 1.7%, at 12,698.09. The S&P 500 was off 36.04 points, or 0.9%, at 4,151.28."

All six stocks have soared this year, but only Nvidia has made up for last year’s brutal decline for the tech sector, as rising interest rates have pushed the broad stock market down. Even with a 37% gain in 2023, Amazon.com’s AMZN, +4.44% shares are down 31% since the end of 2021.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his lofty revenue expectations were tied to the company’s “killer app,” by which he meant graphics processing units used in data centers that support companies deploying artificial intelligence to enhance their products and services.
